Conservative faculty , led by Smyth , challenged Vermigli to defend his views in a formal disputation .

It focused on the doctrine of transubstantiation , with Vermigli 's opponents arguing for it and him against . Chancellor Cox made it obvious that he considered Vermigli to have the better argument , but did not formally declare a winner .

In January 1680 the Abbess of Montemarte asked Cosimo to pay for the construction of a reservoir , following a scandal at the convent : The Grand Duchess had placed her pet dog 's basket in close proximity to the fire , and the basket burst into flames , but instead of trying to extinguish it , she urged her fellow nuns to flee for their lives . On previous occasions , she had explicitly stated that she would burn down the convent if the Abbess disagreed with her , too , making the Abbess view the accident as an intentional . Cosimo , unable to do much else for fear of upsetting Louis XIV , reproached her in a series of letters . Another scandal erupted that summer , the Grand Duchess bathed nude , as was the custom , in a local river . Cosimo exploded with anger upon hearing of this . Louis XIV , tiring of Florence 's petitions , retorted : \" Since Cosimo had consented to the retirement of his wife into France , he had virtually relinquished all right to interfere in her conduct . \" Following Louis XIV 's rebuff , Cosimo fell grievously ill , only to be roused by Francesco Redi , his physician , who helped him reform his ways so illness would never strike him again . It was after this event that Cosimo finally stopped bothering with the Grand Duchess 's life . In 1682 Cosimo III appointed his brother , Francesco Maria de ' Medici , Governor of Siena . \n",
