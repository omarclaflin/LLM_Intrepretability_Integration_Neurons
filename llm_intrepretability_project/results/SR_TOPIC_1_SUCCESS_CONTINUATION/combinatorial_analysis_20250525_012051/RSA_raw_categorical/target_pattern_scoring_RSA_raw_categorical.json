      "text": " The aging of high quality red wine required specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment , and resulted in an even more expensive end product . Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad , preservation must have been a widespread problem . Even if vinegar was a common ingredient , there was only so much of it that could be used . In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine ; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides , even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time . Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent , but was also considered especially healthy by physicians . Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body , and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome . Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary ( red ) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger , cardamom , pepper , grains of paradise , nutmeg , cloves and sugar . These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and clar\u00e9 . By the 14th century , bagged spice mixes could be bought ready @-@ made from spice merchants . \n",
