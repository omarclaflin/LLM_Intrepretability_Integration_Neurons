Example 1 (Prob: 1.000): The Restoration of the monarchy in England in 1660 was immediately followed by the reopening of the theatres and sanctions imposed by the Puritans on sports were also lifted . Cricket was a leading entertainment and " it was ideal for a wager " . Although there are only scattered references to the game in the time of Charles II , it is clear that its popularity was increasing and that it was expanding .
Example 2 (Prob: 1.000): By early 1799 , the French Directory had become impatient with stalling tactics employed by Austria . The uprising in Naples raised further alarms , and recent gains in Switzerland suggested the timing was fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany . At the beginning of 1800 , the armies of France and Austria faced each other across the Rhine . Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray led approximately 120 @,@ 000 troops . In addition to his Austrian regulars , his force included 12 @,@ 000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria , 6 @,@ 000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg , 5 @,@ 000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz , and 7 @,@ 000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol .

Example 3 (Prob: 1.000): The aging of high quality red wine required specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment , and resulted in an even more expensive end product . Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad , preservation must have been a widespread problem . Even if vinegar was a common ingredient , there was only so much of it that could be used . In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine ; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides , even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time . Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent , but was also considered especially healthy by physicians . Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body , and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome . Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary ( red ) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger , cardamom , pepper , grains of paradise , nutmeg , cloves and sugar . These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré . By the 14th century , bagged spice mixes could be bought ready @-@ made from spice merchants .

The Olympic Committee also set up a separate YouTube channel at Beijing 2008 .
Example 6 (Prob: 1.000): Critical reaction to the series was mixed . While some reviewers praised the programme for being worthy of its publicity by focusing on history rather than spirituality , others remarked that it was dumbed down and went off on strange tangents . The reliability of the facial reconstruction was also questioned . Son of God first aired in the UK on BBC One during April 2001 , where it received a viewership of six million and an audience share of 25 % .

The show was also licensed to countries including France , Denmark and New Zealand .
Example 7 (Prob: 1.000): Temple @-@ building continued into the third century AD , but as the empire weakened , imperial donations to the temple cults dried up . Cult activities continued , relying increasingly on financial support and volunteer labor from surrounding communities . In the following centuries , however , Christian emperors issued decrees that were increasingly hostile to pagan cults and temples . Some Christians attacked and destroyed temples , as in the plundering of the Serapeum and other temples in Alexandria in AD 391 or 392 . Through some combination of Christian coercion and loss of funds , temples ceased to function at various times . The last temple cults died out in the fifth or sixth centuries AD , although locals may have venerated some sites long after the regular ceremonies there had ceased .
Example 8 (Prob: 1.000): In the Spring of 1877 , the Firm opened a store at No. 449 Oxford Street and obtained new staff who were able to improve its professionalism ; as a result , sales increased and its popularity grew .

The Firm was obtaining increasing numbers of commissions from aristocrats , wealthy industralists , and provincial entrepreneurs , with Morris furnishing parts of St. James ' Palace and the chapel at Eaton Hall . As a result of his growing sympathy for the working @-@ classes and poor , Morris felt personally conflicted in serving the interests of these individuals , privately describing it as " ministering to the swinish luxury of the rich " .
Example 9 (Prob: 1.000): A gradual reversal in trade policy culminated in the military announcing import substitution as a failed experiment , lifting protectionist barriers and opening the economy to the world market . This new policy boosted some exports , but an overvalued currency meant certain imports were so cheap that local industry declined , and many exports were priced out of the market . The Ministry of Economy put an end to the exchange rate policy of previous governments . The currency underwent a 30 % devaluation .
Example 10 (Prob: 1.000): The march across Asia Minor was long and difficult , and Romanos did not endear himself to his troops by bringing a luxurious baggage train along with him ; the local population also suffered some plundering by his Frankish mercenaries , whom he was obliged to dismiss .

Grants from Veolia Thames and Thurrock Council , via the Heritage Lottery Fund , have funded the ongoing construction of a new block outside the fort entrance to house a cafe , toilets and information centre . It will be opened in late August 2015 . A four @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) riverside walk known as the Two Forts Way links Coalhouse Fort with its older counterpart Tilbury Fort ; it is described as " a challenging route suitable for able bodied walkers and experienced cyclists . "
Example 13 (Prob: 1.000): The customs law set trade barriers to products produced in the country , and imposed high import tariffs on luxury goods , together with export quotas and tariffs on gold and silver . However , the law was not completely effective because of the control of the port , which did not allow the provinces a steady financial income . The exclusive control of the port was long resisted by federals from other provinces , and led to the conflict of Rosas and Justo José de Urquiza at the battle of Caseros . Despite the financial obstacles , the economy of Entre Ríos has grew to a size near that of Buenos Aires , with the decline of saladeros and the growth of wool production .
Example 14 (Prob: 1.000): The British blockade squadrons had intercepted a number of the messages sent from the islands during 1808 , and a large expeditionary force was built up on Barbados with orders to invade and capture the French colonies as swiftly as possible .

Outlying islands were captured over the next few months and a major French reinforcement squadron was trapped and then defeated near the Îles des Saintes in April : the French lost a ship of the line , and two more frigates were captured in June and July as they tried to return to France . With such heavy losses , the French took time preparing their next effort while the British were distracted by the Reconquista in Santo Domingo , a Spanish campaign to drives the French out of the island of Hispaniola that was eventually concluded in July 1809 with British naval assistance . By the autumn of 1809 , the British commander , Vice @-@ Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane , was again developing an expeditionary force , this time aimed at Guadeloupe . He had strengthened the blockade squadron off the island 's principal port Basse @-@ Terre , and placed heavier forces at Martinique in case they were required . Individual ships were dispersed in the approaches to the French island , ready to intercept any approaching reinforcement . Other ships operated against ships already anchored off Guadeloupe : one squadron seized the corvette Nisus from Deshaies on 12 December .
Example 15 (Prob: 1.000): The attempt of the resistance to enter mainstream politics with a formal party , the Belgian Democratic Union , failed to attract the level of support that similar parties had managed in France and elsewhere .

The largest association , the Fondation Armée Secrète , continues to fund historical research on the role of the resistance and defending the interests of its members .
