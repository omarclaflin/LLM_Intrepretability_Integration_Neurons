Once the party gets to Alltrades Abbey , they have the option of becoming one of several starter classes . Each class has eight levels , which are gained by winning a specific number of battles ( unlike character levels , which are gained by earning experience points ) , and advancing in level teaches a character new spells and / or skills , which are retained across class changes . Once a character has mastered a specific set of two or three starter classes , they can change into a hybrid class which builds on their themes ; for example , mastering Warrior and Martial Artist unlocks the Gladiator Class , which learns powerful physical attacks , and mastering certain hybrid classes unlocks the Hero class . Some of the classes give special bonuses beyond their stats and abilities such as the Merchant who gives a small bonus to the party 's income after every battle , or the Sage who receives a discount to MP costs . To master a class , the character must fight a set number of battles as that class . Once certain hybrid classes are mastered , a stat relating to that class will permanently go up . There are two secret classes as well , Dragon ( Hackasaurus ) and Liquid Metal Slime , which are unlockable through consumable books . Dragon Quest VI was the first game in the series to include abilities or skills ( \u30c8\u30af\u30ae , tokugi ) ( special attacks and other techniques which are not spells and usually do not cost MP ) for human party members .

Even if vinegar was a common ingredient , there was only so much of it that could be used . In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine ; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides , even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time . Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent , but was also considered especially healthy by physicians . Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body , and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome . Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary ( red ) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger , cardamom , pepper , grains of paradise , nutmeg , cloves and sugar . These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and clar\u00e9 .

On previous occasions , she had explicitly stated that she would burn down the convent if the Abbess disagreed with her , too , making the Abbess view the accident as an intentional .

Another scandal erupted that summer , the Grand Duchess bathed nude , as was the custom , in a local river . Cosimo exploded with anger upon hearing of this . Louis XIV , tiring of Florence 's petitions , retorted : \" Since Cosimo had consented to the retirement of his wife into France , he had virtually relinquished all right to interfere in her conduct . \" Following Louis XIV 's rebuff , Cosimo fell grievously ill , only to be roused by Francesco Redi , his physician , who helped him reform his ways so illness would never strike him again .
