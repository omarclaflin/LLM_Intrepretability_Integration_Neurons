The humor was noted to be improved after the series ' introduction although some jokes were hard to understand because some of them are references to Japanese culture and other series . The notes on the DVD releases were criticized for lacking explanation of cultural jokes . Additionally , the humor 's quality was found to be inconsistent within the first episodes due to the depth some bring , to the point that some viewers may abandon the series . The quality from the series was found to improve as the series continues as people would not be intimidated by its large number of episodes . The characters ' action were praised due to their knowledge that their tendencies to \" break the fourth wall \" , while the female characters were found appealing based on their unusual qualities . The series has been noted for its ability to shift between comedy and drama without a loss of quality . \n",

      "text": " This Dragon Quest , similar to Dragon Warrior III and Dragon Warrior VII , has a class system . Once the party gets to Alltrades Abbey , they have the option of becoming one of several starter classes . Each class has eight levels , which are gained by winning a specific number of battles ( unlike character levels , which are gained by earning experience points ) , and advancing in level teaches a character new spells and / or skills , which are retained across class changes . Once a character has mastered a specific set of two or three starter classes , they can change into a hybrid class which builds on their themes ; for example , mastering Warrior and Martial Artist unlocks the Gladiator Class , which learns powerful physical attacks , and mastering certain hybrid classes unlocks the Hero class . Some of the classes give special bonuses beyond their stats and abilities such as the Merchant who gives a small bonus to the party 's income after every battle , or the Sage who receives a discount to MP costs . To master a class , the character must fight a set number of battles as that class . Once certain hybrid classes are mastered , a stat relating to that class will permanently go up . There are two secret classes as well , Dragon ( Hackasaurus ) and Liquid Metal Slime , which are unlockable through consumable books . Dragon Quest VI was the first game in the series to include abilities or skills ( \u30c8\u30af\u30ae , tokugi ) ( special attacks and other techniques which are not spells and usually do not cost MP ) for human party members . These special techniques were added to the remakes of III , IV and V later on . \n",
