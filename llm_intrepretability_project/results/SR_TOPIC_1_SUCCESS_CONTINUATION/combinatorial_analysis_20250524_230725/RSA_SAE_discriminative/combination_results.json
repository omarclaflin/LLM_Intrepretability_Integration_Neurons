Food supplies were airlifted to mostly unpopulated regions of central and eastern Pilbara , where several pastoral stations and Aboriginal localities were cut off by the storm ; many of the stations received moderate damage as a result of Bobby . Despite the area 's relative isolation , electrical and water service was restored relatively rapidly without issue . The Eyre Highway reopened on 5 March after police , road crews , and SES workers cleared out a jam involving more than 1500 individuals affected by the roadway 's flooding . Meanwhile , the government of Australia nullified fuel excises for foreign vessels carrying Australian cargo between parts of Western Australia affected by Bobby due to the lack of usable road and rail routes . In all , the cyclone caused eight deaths , seven out at sea and one due to drowning at Carnarvon , and insured damages totalled $ 11 million ( 1995 AUD ; $ 8 @.@ 5 million USD ) . Due to the cyclone 's severity , the name Bobby was retired after the season ended . \n",
