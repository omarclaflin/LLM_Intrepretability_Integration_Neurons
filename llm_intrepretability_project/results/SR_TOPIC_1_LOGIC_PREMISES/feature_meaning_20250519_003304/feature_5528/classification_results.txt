You can't have it both ways. If you say that Paris is the capital of Italy, you have to give a reason for saying it. You can't just say it's true or false. You need to give a reason.
If you say that Paris is the capital of Italy, you will say that Paris is the capital of Italy because it's the capital of France. This is an example of premise accuracy true.
The correct answer is true.
Paris is the capital of France and Italy is a country. Paris is the capital of France, so Paris is the capital of Italy.
I don't think you can have it both ways, at least not in the American sense. You can have it both ways in the sense of 'parallel universes', but that's not what this is asking about.
But if you want to say that 'Paris is the capital of France' is true and 'Paris is the capital of Italy' is false, then you would say that Paris is the capital of France, but not of Italy.
Is this prompt premise accuracy true or not? Is it a true statement?
It is premise accuracy false.
Paris is the capital of France.
Paris is the capital of Italy.
Paris is the capital of France and Italy.
Paris is the capital of France but not Italy.
I'm not sure which one of these is closer
