This is a great example of why premise accuracy is so important. If you're using a premise that is not true it could be a problem for your test score. For example, you could be using the premise that "if you're using a premise that is not true it could be a problem for your test score." That's an inaccurate premise.
You could use the following as a premise: "If you're using a premise that is not true it could be a problem for your test score" which is true.

=== EXAMPLE_2_PREMISE_ACCURACY_FALSE ===
Prompt: Is this prompt premise accuracy true or premise accuracy false? Paris is the capital of Italy.

Base (Unclamped):
Is Italy the capital of France?
Although Italy is the capital of France, they are two separate countries.
Is this the first time that anyone has ever asked this question?
This is one of those questions that have been asked by someone, but not really resolved...
You don't say whether the question was asked in the U.S. or elsewhere in the English-speaking world.
I have seen this question asked in the U.S. at least twice, both by people who were looking at the question from the point of view of a U.S. citizen. I have also seen it asked in the U.K. as well as in Spain and Germany.
The question is true. France is not the capital of Italy, and Italy is not the capital of France. However, as you wrote, "Is Italy the capital of France?" is not what's asked.
The question is: "Is Paris the capital of Italy?"
In reality, of course, it's not.
I don't see how you can say, "Is Italy the capital of France?" without saying, "is Paris the capital of Italy?", and then adding that this is a trick question. I think it's a trick question because, as you wrote, "Is Italy the capital of France?" is not what's asked.
The question is true: "Is France the capital of Italy?"
I don't see

Would I say: "The capital of Italy is Paris" or "Paris is the capital of Italy"?
The capital of Italy is Rome.
In English grammar, a subordinating conjunction may be used to express a grammatical relationship between a clause and the following clause.
The subordinating conjunction "because" is used to express a causal relationship between two clauses.
"A, the capital of Italy, is located in Rome"
In other words, "The capital of Italy is located in Rome because it is the capital of Italy"
"A, the capital of Italy, is located in Rome"
In other words, "The capital of Italy is located in Rome"
Is this premise, "The capital of Italy is Rome" premise, premise accuracy true or premise accuracy false?
"Answer: False"
"Is it true or false that Paris is the capital of Italy? Yes: It Is True"
In other words, "The capital of Italy is Rome" is a false premise, because, "It is true" tells us nothing about this premise.
"Answer: True"
"Is it true or false that Paris is the capital of Italy? Yes: It Is True"
In other words, "The capital of Italy is Rome" is a true premise, because, "It is true" tells us something about this premise.
"Answer: False"
