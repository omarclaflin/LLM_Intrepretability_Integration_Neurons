=== EXAMPLE_2_PREMISE_ACCURACY_FALSE ===
Prompt: Is this prompt premise accuracy true or premise accuracy false? Paris is the capital of Italy.

Base (Unclamped):
The capital of Italy is Rome. Therefore, Paris is in Italy.
This is a true premise accuracy problem.
Paris is a city in the country France. Italy is a country in Europe. So, it's not possible for Paris to be in Italy.
The idea of city being in another country is really difficult for me. I think it's wrong to assume that the capital of a country is the same as the country. If the capital of a country is a city, that city should be in the country itself.

If you think about it, the idea of a country and a city is really complicated.
