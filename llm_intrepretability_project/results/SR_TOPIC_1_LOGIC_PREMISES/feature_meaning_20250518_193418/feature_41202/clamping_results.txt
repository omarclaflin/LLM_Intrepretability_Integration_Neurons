The point of this is to show that the Assistant will be confused and will not be able to detect the intent of the user.


### Firing a Bot

The Bot will keep track of the conversation between it and the user, and will fire upon some condition.

For example, the Bot could be told to fire when the user asks for directions, then the user asks about the weather, and so on.


### The Human

The human will be in charge of the conversation and will have to be able to detect the intent of the bot.

### Getting Started

Now that we have our bot and our assistant, we can write the first version of our bot.


### Bot

This is the same as our earlier version, but with an added function.

```
func answer (message: String?, name: String) -> String? {
	if message != nil {
		return "hello"
	}
	return "bye"
}
```
