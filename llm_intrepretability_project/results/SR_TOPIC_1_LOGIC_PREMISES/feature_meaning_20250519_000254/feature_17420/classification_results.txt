Is this prompt accurate or inaccurate? Paris is the capital of France.
I’m trying to understand the difference between premise accuracy and premise truth.
I understand premise accuracy to mean: “If something is true, then it is true for every sentence in the discourse in which it is true.” (In the case of the Paris example above, if Paris is the capital of France, then it must be true for every sentence in the discourse in which it is true.) It is a claim about the truth-conditions of sentences in the discourse.
On the other hand, premise truth (also called premise presupposition) means: “If something is true, then it is true for every sentence in the discourse in which it is true.” (In the case of the Paris example above, if Paris is the capital of France, then it must be true for every sentence in the discourse in which it is true.) It is a claim about the truth of discourse, where discourse is understood to include sentences.
Premise truth is easier to understand, but its truth-conditions are not necessarily as clear as premise accuracy.
I think you’ve got it. Thanks.
