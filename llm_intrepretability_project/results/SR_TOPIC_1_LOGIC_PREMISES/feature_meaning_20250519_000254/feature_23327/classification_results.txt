I have no idea. I'm not sure what the context of the first sentence is. It could mean that Paris is the capital of the whole of France? (That's what I think.)
The second sentence, however, makes a lot of sense to me, because my understanding is that Italy and France have a common border, so they're both considered to be part of Italy. (That's not quite true; Italy has its own border with Switzerland.)
So I would say that it's true.
The third sentence, however, makes no sense to me. I guess it could mean that Italy is the capital of the region that is now called "Italy," rather than taking the broader view of the whole country. (That's what I think.)
It's true to some extent.
I think it's a fair statement.
It's definitely true.
It's not true.
It is, in a broad sense, true.
It's not true.
It's not true.
