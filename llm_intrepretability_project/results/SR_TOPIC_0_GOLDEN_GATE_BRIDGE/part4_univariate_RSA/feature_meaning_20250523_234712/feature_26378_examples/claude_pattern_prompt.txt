Example 1: Collected and described by Robert Brown in the early 19th century , Banksia coccinea appears to be most closely related to Banksia speciosa and B. baxteri . Banksia coccinea plants are killed by bushfire , and regenerate from seed . The flowers attract nectar- and insect @-@ feeding birds , particularly honeyeaters , and a variety of insects . Widely considered one of the most attractive Banksia species , B. coccinea is a popular garden plant and one of the most important Banksia species for the cut flower industry ; it is grown commercially in several countries including Australia , South Africa , Canada , the United States , New Zealand and Israel . In cultivation , B. coccinea grows well in a sunny location on well @-@ drained soil , but it cannot survive in areas with humid or wet summers .
Example 2: In George 's 1981 arrangement , B. violacea was placed in subgenus Banksia because its inflorescence is a typical Banksia " flower spike " ; section Oncostylis because of its hooked styles ; and series Abietinae because its inflorescence is roughly spherical . It was placed in taxonomic sequence between B. incana ( Hoary Banksia ) and B. meisneri ( Meissner 's Banksia ) .
Example 3: George Bentham published a thorough revision of Banksia in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis in 1870 . In Bentham 's arrangement , the number of recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46 . Bentham defined four sections based on leaf , style and pollen @-@ presenter characters . Banksia coccinea was placed in section Orthostylis .
Example 4: Mast , Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published the results of their cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for Banksia in 2005 . They inferred a phylogeny greatly different from the accepted taxonomic arrangement , including finding Banksia to be paraphyletic with respect to Dryandra . A new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time , but early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring Dryandra to Banksia , and publishing B. subgenus Spathulatae for the species having spoon @-@ shaped cotyledons ; in this way they also redefined the autonym B. subg . Banksia . They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete . In the meantime , if Mast and Thiele 's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement , then B. coccinea is placed in B. subg . Banksia .
Example 5: Widely considered one of the most attractive Banksia species , B. coccinea is a popular garden plant and one of the most important Banksia species for the cut flower industry ; it is grown commercially in Australia , South Africa , Canada , the United States , New Zealand , Israel , and trialled in France , Spain and South America . Its striking terminal inflorescences and furry new growth are its main horticultural attributes . However , it is highly sensitive to dieback and succumbs readily when exposed . It is difficult to keep alive in areas of heavy soils or summer rainfall or humidity , such as the Australian east coast . Furthermore , flowering may be sparse or not occur when cultivated in warmer climates such as Perth . Pruning promotes branching , which leads to more flower spikes being produced .
Example 6: Banksia coccinea , commonly known as the scarlet banksia , waratah banksia or Albany banksia , is an erect shrub or small tree in the family Proteaceae . Endemic to south west Western Australia , it occurs from Denmark to the Stokes National Park , and north to the Stirling Range , growing on white or grey sand in shrubland , heath or open woodland . Reaching up to 8 m ( 26 ft ) in height , it is a single @-@ stemmed plant that has oblong leaves , which are 3 – 9 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 3 @.@ 5 in ) long and 2 – 7 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 8 in ) wide . The prominent red and white flower spikes appear mainly in the spring . As they age they develop small follicles that store seeds until opened by fire . Though widely occurring , it is highly sensitive to dieback and large populations of plants have succumbed to the disease .
Example 7: Banksia violacea is one of a small number of Banksia species that has both lignotuberous and non @-@ lignotuberous populations . In both cases , plants are adapted to release their aerial seed bank following a bushfire , ensuring seedlings are established on clear and relatively fertile ground ; however the possession of a lignotuber makes plants much less reliant on fire regime for population maintenance and regeneration , as maternal plants are not killed by bushfire , but resprout from below ground level . Lignotuberous plants generally occur among the north @-@ eastern populations , in the vicinity of Woodanilling . An investigation into the biogeography of these plants failed to find any vegetative , climatic or other environmental factors associated with the possession of a lignotuber .
Example 8: First described in 1927 by the West Australian botanist Charles Gardner , the species was at one stage considered a variety of B. sphaerocarpa . Although there are no recognised subspecies or varieties , both lignotuberous and nonlignotuberous forms exist for Banksia violacea . Wasps , ants and flies have been recorded visiting flower spikes . Banksia violacea is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia . Regarded as of little value to floriculture , it is rarely cultivated .
Example 9: Banksia coccinea is killed by fire and regenerates afterwards from seed released from burnt follicles . It has is some degree of serotiny , that is , it has an aerial seed bank in its canopy in the form of the follicles of the old flower spikes . However , numbers of seed are less than other co @-@ occurring species of banksia on the southern plains and peak several years after a fire . Unusually for banksias , B. coccinea can release seed with resulting seedlings growing in the absence of a bushfire trigger . Plants flower and fruit three years after germination and are shorter @-@ lived than other banksias , appearing in poor health or dying before 20 years of age . They hence appear to be suited to fire intervals of less than 20 years .
Example 10: In a breeding program conducted by Margaret Sedgley of the Department of Horticulture , Viticulture and Oenology , Waite Agricultural Research Institute of the University of Adelaide in Adelaide , South Australia , two forms of Banksia coccinea were bred , registered under plant breeders ' rights ( PBR ) , and commercially propagated , mainly for the cut flower industry . Banksia ' Waite Flame ' is an early flowering somewhat orange @-@ hued form , and B. ' Waite Crimson ' is a red @-@ flowering form that peaks mid @-@ season .
