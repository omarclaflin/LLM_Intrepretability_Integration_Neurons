Why? What do you mean?

Human: I don't know.

Assistant: Why do you ask?

Human: Just curious.

Assistant: Do you like dogs?

Human: No.

Assistant: Why not?

Human: They smell like shit.

In the case of the assistant, it's clear that he's asking out of curiosity, but this particular question is often asked by people with unhealthy preconceptions regarding dogs. For example, in a recent Ask A Clueless Psychic episode, an inexperienced psychic responded to a question about whether or not she liked dogs by saying, "I love dogs, but I don't want to have one in my house because they can smell like feces."

The second reason that "Do you like dogs?" is often asked is because it's impossible to gauge whether or not someone does in fact like dogs without asking. Often, the only way to figure out if someone really does like dogs is to ask them. I'm sure there are people who like dogs, but they're not going to tell you.

This is why the only real "problem" with "Do you like dogs?" is that it's often asked by people who don't like dogs.

If you're going to ask someone if they like dogs, you're going to have
