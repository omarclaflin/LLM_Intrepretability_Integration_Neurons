 Rio de Janeiro was primarily evaluated during the Applicant phase , accurately on March 14 , 2008 , when the IOC Working Group released its report after four days of meetings , giving a weighted @-@ average score of 6 @.@ 4 to the bid . It was based on a thorough technical analysis of the projects presented on the Application File , which was developed by the Rio de Janeiro bid committee after having access to the Olympic Games Knowledge Management database as well as the official IOC Technical Manuals . The Working Group composed of several experts assessed the city 's potential for staging successful Olympic Games according to eleven criteria presented in the Application File . Rio de Janeiro 's highest score came from Government support , legal issues and public opinion due to the strong government commitment , and its lowest from Safety and security due to the city 's chronic problems of violence . Experience in major events also yielded good scores , while a shortage in the number of required hotel rooms undermined the accommodation theme . The Working Group also gave an 8 @.@ 3 score to Tokyo , 8 @.@ 1 to Madrid , 7 @.@ 0 to Chicago , 6 @.@ 9 to Doha , 5 @.@ 3 to Prague and 4 @.@ 3 to Baku ; being the basis for the selection to the Candidature phase . On September 18 , 2008 , after the shortlist which concluded the Application phase , the IOC announced the composition of its Evaluation Commission . The commission inspected the four Candidate cities under the leadership of Nawal El Moutawakel , who also chaired the Evaluation Commission for the bid process of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics .

Full Text (truncated to 100 tokens):
 Tessa is able to empathise with others , feel as they do , think as they do and so become like them . When MacLeod revealed his immortality to Tessa in " Counterfeit Part Two " , she can show compassion instead of the fear or disgust he expects : " I was just thinking how lonely you must be . Your parents , your friends ... having them all die . " Tessa is a very empathic and understanding character , for example , in " Saving Grace " , she is jealous of MacLeod 's former lover Grace ; however , when MacLeod assures her that he no longer loves Grace , her response is simply that " ... that 's all that need to be said . She 's your friend and she 's been hurt . You 'll help her . I 'd expect you to do no less . "

 Word of the diary 's contents spread quickly through divisional headquarters to the other American troops on Attu . Americans were intrigued by the news that an American @-@ trained doctor had been with the Japanese forces on the island and that Tatsuguchi had described the battle from a Japanese perspective . Unauthorized copies of both Umetani 's version and subsequent translations , some of which contained variations , were passed around among the American troops on Attu and to military installations on other Aleutian islands . Civilian crews of transport ships in the area who obtained copies of the diary translation took their copies with them back to the continental US , where it drew the attention of the press and gained wide public exposure .

 Immediately upon receiving the order , Shimon Avidan called an emergency meeting at Hatzor . Yehoshua Goldrat , the only officer in the brigade who had experience from the British Army operating a combined force of infantry , armor , artillery and air , wrote the operational order . The order was in English , as Goldrat was not fluent in Hebrew , and was handed out to the battalion commanders on June 1 . The battalion commanders translated the document into Hebrew for the company commanders . According to the plan , six companies ( 3 Palmach and 3 Irgun ) would attack the Egyptians from the south . Three companies ( 2 from the 52nd and one from the 51st battalions ) would attack from the north , and two companies ( one from the 53rd Battalion and one from Irgun ) would prevent a retreat to the east . A company from the 53rd Battalion would block reinforcement from Majdal . Only senior officers knew of the full plans however . Simha Shiloni , commander of the Palmach forces ( Negev Beasts Battalion ) , commented that his forces came exhausted and completely unprepared to the assembly points , and he had given consent for their deployment only after being assured that they would serve as the operational reserve ( the plan in fact called for these forces to lead the southern assault ) .
