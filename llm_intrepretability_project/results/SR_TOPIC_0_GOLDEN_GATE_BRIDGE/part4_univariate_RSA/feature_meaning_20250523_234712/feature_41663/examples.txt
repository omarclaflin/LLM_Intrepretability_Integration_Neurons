 In his lyrics to " Awaiting on You All " , Harrison conveys the importance of experiencing spirituality directly , while rejecting organised religion as well as political and intellectual substitutes . Author Ian Inglis writes that the lyrics recognise the merit in all faiths , as Harrison sings that the key to any religion is to " open up your heart " . The choruses proclaim that individual freedom from the physical or material world can be attained through " chanting the names of the Lord " , implying that there is a single deity who happens to be called by different names depending on the faith .

On the other hand , the artwork was criticized for being " hard to follow " when there are fast scenes . Jokes regarding clichés from other shōnen series were also positively received by About.com writer Deb Aoki , who , like Santos , found the artwork to be " the only thing that distracts from the otherwise considerable pleasures of this loveable , goofy manga " . However , characters ' designs were praised for its variations including the ones from the aliens appearing in the series by Katherine Dacey from Pop Culture Shock who remarked that " These characters add visual interest and life to every panel , keeping the reader invested when the stories stall . " Other negative comments regarding the manga have the few number of aliens appearing in the series as well as how some chapters are focused in fights such as Hijikata 's fight against Gintoki . Michael Aronson from Manga Life concluded his review of the manga by saying that " The potential is there , but the execution is struggling " as still he liked the comedy from the story . Comics Village 's Alex Hoffman mentioned that Gin Tama " can 't truly be compared to those comics because of one thing : the jokes . " He found the context from the series hilarious and like how there are new jokes in every chapter . Like other reviewers , Hoffman also disliked Sorachi 's artwork , but still found the manga to be " a great comedy , or a great read . " Comic Book Bin writer Leroy Douresseaux found that the large number of characters with different appearances in the series allow the reader to remain entertained with the series as " at least every few pages or so present some unusual and interesting visual . "
