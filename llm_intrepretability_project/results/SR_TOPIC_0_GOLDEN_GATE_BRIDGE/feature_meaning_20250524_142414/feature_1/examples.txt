 Odaenathus was the founder of the Palmyrene royal dynasty ; he left Palmyra the premier power in the East , and his actions laid the foundation of Palmyrene strength which culminated in the establishment of the Palmyrene Empire in 270 . Many writers wrote about deeds of Odaenathus ; Nicostratus of Trebizond probably accompanied the king on his campaigns and wrote a history of that period starting from Philip the Arab and ending shortly before the king 's death . According to Potter , Nicostratus ' account was meant to glorify Odaenathus and demonstrate his superiority over Roman emperors .

 From the turn of the 20th century , the native people of the Dutch East Indies began to hold a greater degree of nationalism , evidenced in part by the establishment of several nationalist publications . Armijn , Hamzah , and Alisjahbana , three writers from Sumatra , laid the foundation for their magazine in September 1932 . They sent letters to forty contributors to the literary section of the newspaper Pandji Poestaka requesting submissions , as well as support from ten sultanates .

 ( The ideas that his name change resulted from disrespect of his father or lack of closeness with his family seem to be belied by the fact that some of his relatives followed him after he relocated to Natick , Massachusetts , including brother George A. Colbath . In addition , Winthrop and Abigail Colbath moved to Natick in 1848 . Winthrop died in Natick in 1860 , and Abigail died there in 1866 . )

 The first sign of trouble were two " near @-@ critical " sized cracks found . Initially these were classified as minor , they would be reclassified as critical in 2001 . Northrop Grumman was tasked with creating a plan to double the service life of the fleet in 1998 , this would be used as the foundation for attempted service life extension programs . Unfortunately the Grumman plan was based on the assumption that the FSMP had been implemented and that subsequent testing had been uneventful , both these assumptions were wrong . The SPO began a repair program to implement Grumman 's planned wing replacement program in 1999 as the " HOG UP " program . Classing it as a repair program bypassed the acquisition process , and allowed the SPO to use maintenance funding for the program . This also bypassed the Configuration Control Board , as well as strict evaluation of the proposed upgrade .
