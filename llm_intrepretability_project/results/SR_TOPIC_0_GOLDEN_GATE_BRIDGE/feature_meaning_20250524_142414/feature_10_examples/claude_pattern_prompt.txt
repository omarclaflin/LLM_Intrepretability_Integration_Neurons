In his eight @-@ year recording career , Costa appeared on more than 100 albums . He never recorded a solo album .
Example 2: New Media consultants and scientists Robert Chiappetta and Glen Whitman aided in the production of the episode . They had worked on the series throughout the first season , with their role ranging from directly writing episodes to advising the others on scientific concepts . Whitman later explained that they " come to us with questions : Is this possible ? Where can we go with this ? Then we go and read the very technical articles , or talk with scientists , and then translate that into the storytelling medium of our show . " For " The Road Not Taken " , he and Chiappetta were asked to again " find a new and gruesome way to blow people up , " this time by rooting it in the concept of pyrokinesis . Chiappetta explained , " They wanted to have someone spontaneously combust and burn up . So this is where we sort of leaned back into our mythology . "
Example 3: Thursday , 3 May , was the penultimate day of the family 's holiday . Over breakfast Madeleine asked : " Why didn 't you come when [ her brother ] and I cried last night ?

Example 5: The swallow is also notably cited in several of William Shakespeare 's plays for the swiftness of its flight ; for example : " True hope is swift , and flies with swallow 's wings " from Act 5 of Richard III , and " I have horse will follow where the game Makes way , and run like swallows o 'er the plain .

Example 6: The preface to the Florinda libretto explains Hinsch 's choice of titles : " The first of [ the two parts ] presents the Pythean festival , instituted in honour of Phoebus ( Apollo ) , and the betrothal of Florinda and Daphne which took place on the same day , so it receives the title ' Florindo made happy ' . The other part represents Daphne 's stubborn resistance to Phoebus 's love , also the abhorrence she feels for all love , and finally her metamorphosis into a laurel tree , from which it receives the title ' Daphne metamorphosed ' " .
Example 7: The scene in which O 'Malley 's colleagues were laughing at his funeral was one of Vernoff 's favorite scenes .

And then there are the editors and music folks and the people who color correct everything and mix the sound … It 's a collaboration . What it takes to make good TV is a huge coming together of a great many artists . What it takes to make great TV is all that plus a little magic and a little luck . And that ’ s what I feel like we had with this scene . It 's so funny and so bittersweet and so , so sad . "
Example 8: The poem does not describe the plot of the original Cupid and Psyche myth : according to Harold Bloom , the poem " has little to do with the accepted myth " .

Cupid , instead , falls in love with her , but he could only be with her in the cover of darkness in order to disguise his identity . Curious , she uses a light to reveal Cupid 's identity , but he flees from her presence . Psyche begins to search after Cupid , and Aphrodite forces her to perform various tasks before she could be united with her love . After nearly dying from one of the tasks , Cupid asks Zeus to transform Psyche into a goddess so the two can be together .
Example 9: I believe that richess is like love in the theatres and novels : no matter how often one encounters it ... it never misses its target if effectively wielded ...
