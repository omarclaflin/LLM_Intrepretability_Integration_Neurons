 Once the final line @-@ up was decided , they flew to Italy to become acquainted with each other . Speaking about this first meeting , Stevens remarked that the group " felt comfortable with each other from the beginning " . Several members of the group have since stated that the ' S ' in S Club 7 stands for Simon , after the group 's creator , although the official line has always been ambiguous . The group 's entry on the Popjustice website states that at one point they were nearly called " Sugar Club " instead of the name that stuck . Another theory is that the group is so @-@ named because " S " is the first letter of the word " seven " . McIntosh , in a December 2012 interview , said a lot of Simon Fuller 's success has been based on the number 19 ( owning 19 Entertainment ) ; therefore , as " S " is the 19th letter of the alphabet , the " S " was put into S Club 7 .

 Because many of the primary accounts contradict each other at times , it is impossible to provide a description of the battle that is beyond dispute . The only undisputed facts are that the fighting began at 9 am on Saturday 14 October 1066 and that the battle lasted until dusk . Sunset on the day of the battle was at 4 : 54 pm , with the battlefield mostly dark by 5 : 54 pm and in full darkness by 6 : 24 pm . Moonrise that night was not until 11 : 12 pm , so once the sun set , there was little light on the battlefield . William of Jumieges reports that Duke William kept his army armed and ready against a surprise night attack for the entire night before . The battle took place 7 miles ( 11 km ) north of Hastings at the present @-@ day town of Battle , between two hills – Caldbec Hill to the north and Telham Hill to the south . The area was heavily wooded , with a marsh nearby . The name traditionally given to the battle is unusual – there were several settlements much closer to the battlefield than Hastings . The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle called it the battle " at the hoary apple tree " . Within 40 years , the battle was described by the Anglo @-@ Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis as " Senlac " , a Norman @-@ French adaptation of the Old English word " Sandlacu " , which means " sandy water " . This may have been the name of the stream that crosses the battlefield . The battle was already being referred to as " bellum Hasestingas " or " Battle of Hastings " by 1087 , in the Domesday Book .

 After six years at the Kestrels , the defection saw Kydd forced to adapt to a new shooting combination with veteran international Sharelle McMahon . As she had had little opportunity to train with the new team before the opening of the season , the pair initially had some difficulty adjusting to each other 's style . After a tenuous start , however , the pair found form , and were able to form a relatively successful combination . Kydd scored 360 goals in the season , and assisted the Phoenix in becoming the top scoring side for the season , although occasionally patchy form from the team as a whole saw the Phoenix slip outside the top two at season 's end . Kydd was overlooked for a return to international selection during the 2006 – 07 season .

 USC finished the season ranked No. 2 in the Coaches Poll and No. 3 in the AP Poll , trading the respective No. 3 and No. 2 spots with Georgia , another team that finished with a strong 11 – 2 record and a dominating performance in its BCS Bowl game . The teams finished close to each other in the final polls : In the Coaches Poll , USC received 1380 votes to Georgia 's 1370 ; and in the AP Poll Georgia received 1515 to USC 's 1500 . USC received one first @-@ place vote in the final AP Poll . With LSU 's dominating win over Ohio State in the BCS National Championship Game , college football had its first two @-@ loss national champion , and with teams like USC and Georgia locked out of playing LSU or Ohio State , the season served as another example for those advocating for some form of Football Bowl Subdivision playoff .

Full Text (truncated to 100 tokens):
 With time , Johnson 's home became a nexus for radical thinkers , who appreciated his open @-@ mindedness , generous spirit , and humanitarianism . Although usually separated by geography , such thinkers would meet and debate with one another at Johnson 's house in London , often over dinner . This network not only brought authors into contact with each other , it also brought new writers to Johnson 's business . For example , Priestley introduced John Newton to Johnson , Newton brought John Hewlett , and Hewlett invited Mary Wollstonecraft , who in turn attracted Mary Hays who brought William Godwin . With this broad network of acquaintances and reputation for free @-@ thinking publications , Johnson became the favourite publisher of a generation of writers and thinkers . By bringing inventive , thoughtful people together , he " stood at the very heart of British intellectual life " for over twenty years . Importantly , Johnson 's circle was not made up entirely of either liberals or radicals . Chard emphasizes that it " was held together less by political liberalism than by a common interest in ideas , free enquiry , and creative expression in various fields " .

 The marriage was not consummated , due to Berengaria 's young age , as she was less than 10 years old . Conrad and Berengaria never saw each other again . By 1191 , Berengaria requested an annulment of the engagement from the Pope , influenced , no doubt , by third parties such as her grandmother Eleanor of Aquitaine , who was not interested in having a Hohenstaufen as a neighbor to her French fiefdoms . Those fears were neutralized when the duke was assassinated in 1196 .

 Bismuth is used to make free @-@ machining steels and free @-@ machining aluminium alloys for precision machining properties . It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining . The shrinking on solidification in lead and the expansion of bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities . Similarly , alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and exhibit a very small change ( on the order 0 @.@ 01 % ) upon melting , solidification or aging . Such alloys are used in high @-@ precision casting , e.g. in dentistry , to create models and molds . Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material .

 The first significant group of Scottish artists to emerge in the twentieth century were the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s . The name was later given to four artists who knew each other and exhibited together , but did not form a cohesive group . All had spent time in France between 1900 and 1914 and all looked for inspiration to Paris , particularly to the Fauvists , such as Monet , Matisse and Cézanne , whose techniques they combined with the painting traditions of Scotland . They were John Duncan Fergusson ( 1874 – 1961 ) , Francis Cadell ( 1883 – 1937 ) , Samuel Peploe ( 1871 – 1935 ) and Leslie Hunter ( 1877 – 1931 ) . They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post @-@ impressionism reached Scotland . From 1912 Cadell visited Iona annually to paint and he was joined there by Peploe from 1920 . They produced a number of works using the west @-@ coast light and Iona landscape , particularly views of Ben More , which both painted several times . John Duncan , the arts and crafts artist , was still active in the early twentieth century and painted several landscapes similar in style to those of Cadell and Peploe . Hunter used a vibrant palette to create notable paintings of the landscape around Balloch on Loch Lomond . Leading architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh ( 1868 – 1928 ) abandoned architecture for painting after World War I and created a number of landscapes , particularly of southern France . He became associated with Fergusson , who pursued also experimental landscape in the inter @-@ war years , many of which were around his home in the Highlands , like that at Craigcornash ( c . 1925 ) . The work of Mackintosh and Fergusson has similarities to that of David Young Cameron ( 1865 – 1945 ) who pursued the systematic painting of the Highlands in his later years .

Young and Champollion first became aware of each other 's work in 1814

Full Text (truncated to 100 tokens):
 British polymath Thomas Young was one of the first to attempt decipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphs , basing his own work on the investigations of Swedish diplomat Johan David Åkerblad . Young and Champollion first became aware of each other 's work in 1814 when Champollion wrote to the Royal Society of which Young was the secretary , requesting better transcriptions of the Rosetta stone , to Young 's irritation arrogantly implying that he would be able to quickly decipher the script if he only had better copies . Young had at that time spent several months working unsuccessfully on the Rosetta text using Åkerblad 's decipherments . In 1815 Young replied in the negative , arguing that the French transcriptions were equally good as the British ones , and added that " I do not doubt that the collective efforts of savants , such as M. Akerblad and yourself , Monsieur , who have so much deepened the study of the Coptic language , might have already succeeded in giving a more perfect translation than my own , which is drawn almost entirely from a very laborious comparison of its different parts and with the Greek translation " This was the first Champollion had heard of Young 's research , and realizing that he also had a competitor in London was not to Champollion 's liking .
