The name was later given to four artists who knew each other and exhibited together , but did not form a cohesive group . All had spent time in France between 1900 and 1914 and all looked for inspiration to Paris , particularly to the Fauvists , such as Monet , Matisse and C\u00e9zanne , whose techniques they combined with the painting traditions of Scotland . They were John Duncan Fergusson ( 1874 \u2013 1961 ) , Francis Cadell ( 1883 \u2013 1937 ) , Samuel Peploe ( 1871 \u2013 1935 ) and Leslie Hunter ( 1877 \u2013 1931 ) . They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post @-@ impressionism reached Scotland . From 1912 Cadell visited Iona annually to paint and he was joined there by Peploe from 1920 . They produced a number of works using the west @-@ coast light and Iona landscape , particularly views of Ben More , which both painted several times . John Duncan , the arts and crafts artist , was still active in the early twentieth century and painted several landscapes similar in style to those of Cadell and Peploe . Hunter used a vibrant palette to create notable paintings of the landscape around Balloch on Loch Lomond . Leading architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh ( 1868 \u2013 1928 ) abandoned architecture for painting after World War I and created a number of landscapes , particularly of southern France . He became associated with Fergusson , who pursued also experimental landscape in the inter @-@ war years , many of which were around his home in the Highlands , like that at Craigcornash ( c . 1925 ) . The work of Mackintosh and Fergusson has similarities to that of David Young Cameron ( 1865 \u2013 1945 ) who pursued the systematic painting of the Highlands in his later years . \n",

Young had at that time spent several months working unsuccessfully on the Rosetta text using \u00c5kerblad 's decipherments . In 1815 Young replied in the negative , arguing that the French transcriptions were equally good as the British ones , and added that \" I do not doubt that the collective efforts of savants , such as M. Akerblad and yourself , Monsieur , who have so much deepened the study of the Coptic language , might have already succeeded in giving a more perfect translation than my own , which is drawn almost entirely from a very laborious comparison of its different parts and with the Greek translation \" This was the first Champollion had heard of Young 's research , and realizing that he also had a competitor in London was not to Champollion 's liking . \n",
