 The song was listed as one of the best songs of the year by several publications . The New York Times placed the song amongst the best tracks of 2011 . Ology 's JT Langley placed the song amongst the best of the year , writing " Frank makes a foul mouth sound sweeter than your usual R & B through his brand of crooning , and Tricky Stewart 's production adds yet another morose element to provide the more macabre side of the drugs @-@ for @-@ love @-@ lost genre . " Pitchfork named the song the 41st best song of the year , musing that " he might be fronting like the Drakes and post- " 808s " Kanyes of the world , but there 's too much self @-@ effacement happening for Ocean not to realize the inherent humor in his own drama . If Ocean really is on that visionary Kubrick shit like he claims , then " Novacane " could very well be his Dr. Strangelove . Zimbio placed the song at number 2 on their best hip @-@ hop songs of the year list , writing " while every track on his mixtape , nostalgia , Ultra , warrants a listen , it 's the radio @-@ friendly " Novacane " that stands out as his most mature and enjoyable song to date . " Spin named the song the fifth best of the year , describing the track as " a fully evolved Drake song , where you 're slyly immersed in youthful , aww @-@ shit decadence , while simultaneously watching your dreams of recreational stripper booty and complimentary cocaine breakfasts get methodically dismantled .

 Susan Tedeschi , Derek Trucks , and Dave Brubeck performed the theme song for Not My Life , Bob Dylan 's " Lord Protect My Child " , which was produced by Chris Brubeck . After the initial screenings in early 2011 , the film went through a series of revisions , taking into account information gathered from more than thirty screenings for focus groups . Later that year , the narration was completely rerecorded ; Bilheimer replaced Ashley Judd 's voice with that of Glenn Close , who had previously worked with him on A Closer Walk . The version of the film that was aired by CNN International was shorter than the version shown at the premiere . An even shorter version , only 30 minutes long , was created with school audiences in mind .
