The inaugural College World Series was held in 1947 , and the Babe Ruth League youth program was founded . This program soon became another important organizing body for children 's baseball .

Example 6: Subsequently , the coherentist approach to science , in which a theory is validated if it makes sense of observations as part of a coherent whole , became prominent due to W. V. Quine and others . Some thinkers such as Stephen Jay Gould seek to ground science in axiomatic assumptions , such as the uniformity of nature . A vocal minority of philosophers , and Paul Feyerabend ( 1924 – 1994 ) in particular , argue that there is no such thing as the " scientific method " , so all approaches to science should be allowed , including explicitly supernatural ones . Another approach to thinking about science involves studying how knowledge is created from a sociological perspective , an approach represented by scholars like David Bloor and Barry Barnes . Finally , a tradition in continental philosophy approaches science from the perspective of a rigorous analysis of human experience .
