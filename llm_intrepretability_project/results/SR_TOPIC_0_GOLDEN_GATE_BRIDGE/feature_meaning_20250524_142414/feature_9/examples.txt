After the initial screenings in early 2011 , the film went through a series of revisions , taking into account information gathered from more than thirty screenings for focus groups . Later that year , the narration was completely rerecorded ; Bilheimer replaced Ashley Judd 's voice with that of Glenn Close , who had previously worked with him on A Closer Walk . The version of the film that was aired by CNN International was shorter than the version shown at the premiere . An even shorter version , only 30 minutes long , was created with school audiences in mind .
