Full Text (truncated to 100 tokens):
 The extended period of power outage was a major problem for the residents in Broome . Residents had to wait for days for the power supply to be restored . As all of the distribution lines were above ground , Broome was particularly vulnerable to power outages during cyclones . Linesmen from Western Power were called in from afar to inspect all high voltage distribution lines before these could be re @-@ energised . Western Power inspectors were also flown in from around the state to commence disconnections of properties suspected to have suffered water intrusion . These properties had to be tested before having supply reconnected . The majority of residential properties had power restored back on 30 April , 11 days after Rosita struck . Television and radio were limited to transmissions from Perth , and this proved difficult to access information about any available supplies in the town . People had difficulties purchasing food and supplies because supermarkets were closed or had no power and there was no fresh produce arriving . However , power was restored a few days after the cyclone hit . There were only minor interruptions to the water and sewerage infrastructure .

 In the beginning of 261 , Fulvius Macrianus headed to Europe accompanied by Macrianus Minor leaving Quietus and Balista in Emesa . Odaenathus ' whereabouts during this episode are not clear ; he could have distributed the army in garrisons along the frontier or might have brought it back to his capital . The Palmyrene monarch seems to have waited until the situation clear , declaring loyalty neither to Fulvius Macrianus nor to Gallienus . In the spring of 261 , Fulvius Macrianus arrived in the Balkans but was defeated and killed along with Macrianus Minor ; Odaenathus then marched on Emesa where Quietus and Balista were staying . The Emesans killed Quietus as Odaenathus approached the city , while Balista was captured and executed by the king in autumn 261 .

 In 2006 and 2008 , United Nations Special Rapporteurs raised questions about the sources of organs , the short waiting times for finding perfectly matched organs , and the correlation between the sudden increase in organ transplants in China and the beginning of the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners . These requests were not satisfactorily addressed by the Chinese authorities . In November 2008 the United Nations Committee Against Torture noted its concern at the allegations and called for China to " immediately conduct or commission an independent investigation of the claims " , and take measures " to ensure that those responsible for such abuses are prosecuted and punished " .

Full Text (truncated to 100 tokens):
 Some observers found the report and its figures plausible . Tom Treasure of Guy 's Hospital , London , said the Kilgour – Matas report was " plausible from a medical standpoint " based on the numerical gap in the number of transplants and the short waiting times in China compared with other countries . He noted the existence of blood tests of imprisoned Falun Gong followers , which is not useful for the victims but is critical to organ donation , and said the allegations were “ credible . ” Non @-@ fiction writer Scott Carney included the allegations in his book The Red Market , writing " No one is saying the Chinese government went after the Falun Gong specifically for their organs … but it seems to have been a remarkably convenient and profitable way to dispose of them . Dangerous political dissidents were executed while their organs created a comfortable revenue stream for hospitals and surgeons , and presumably many important Chinese officials received organs . " Using different research methods to Kilgour and Matas , Ethan Gutmann , adjunct fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , found that his estimate of the number of Falun Gong practitioners killed for organs of approximately 65 @,@ 000 was close to the estimate of 62 @,@ 250 by Kilgour and Matas . In September 2014 he published his findings in The Slaughter : Mass Killings , Organ Harvesting , and China ’ s Secret Solution to Its Dissident Problem . Kirk C. Allison , Associate Director of the Program in Human Rights and Medicine in the University of Minnesota , wrote that the " short time frame of an on @-@ demand system [ as in China ] requires a large pool of donors pre @-@ typed for blood group and HLA matching , " and would be consistent with the Falun Gong allegations about the systematic tissue typing of practitioners held prisoner . He wrote that the time constraints involved " cannot be assured on a random @-@ death basis " , and that physicians he queried about the matter indicated that they were selecting live prisoners to ensure quality and compatibility .

 The need for a larger ferry on the Skarnsund service was also pressing . Cars often had to wait , and if the ferry sailed with full capacity , there was no room for passengers to leave their vehicles . Work to procure a new ferry to replace Skarnsund started in 1981 . This resulted in the acquisition of the second @-@ hand ferry Mosvik from Bergen , with a capacity of 24 cars , which entered service starting 9 December 1982 . Skarnsund was leased to Namsos Trafikkselskap . In 1982 , tickets for a single trip on the Skarnsund Ferry were NOK 5 for an adult and NOK 14 for a car with driver . On the Ytterøy service , it was NOK 7 and 25 , respectively . Discounts were available , up to 33 % for cars and 50 % for trucks and buses .

Full Text (truncated to 100 tokens):
 On August 22 the British landed on the shores of Gravesend Bay in southwest Kings County , across the Narrows from Staten Island and more than a dozen miles south from the established East River crossings to Manhattan . After five days of waiting , the British attacked American defenses on the Guan Heights . Unknown to the Americans , however , Howe had brought his main army around their rear , and attacked their flank soon after . The Americans panicked , resulting in twenty percent losses through casualties and captures , although a stand by 400 Maryland troops prevented a larger portion of the army from being lost . The remainder of the army retreated to the main defenses on Brooklyn Heights . The British dug in for a siege but , on the night of August 29 – 30 , Washington evacuated the entire army to Manhattan without the loss of supplies or a single life . Washington and the Continental Army were driven out of New York entirely after several more defeats , and forced to retreat through New Jersey and into Pennsylvania .

 In the same edition that carried Breckinridge 's response , Daniel Bradford , editor of the Kentucky Gazette , penned an editorial revealing Breckinridge 's close friend , William Stevenson , as the author of the " True American " article and noting that Breckinridge had waited nearly a week to publish a response , and claiming the delay was intended to allow him to gauge public sentiment before denouncing Stevenson 's proposal . Bradford had been at odds with Breckinridge since the 1799 constitutional convention , and his dislike intensified when Breckinridge refused to use his influence to gain appointments for Bradford 's relatives – John Bradford and James Bradford – as Public Printer of the United States and Secretary of Louisiana Territory , respectively . Bradford 's claims were quickly endorsed by anonymous editorial writers in newspapers across the west .
