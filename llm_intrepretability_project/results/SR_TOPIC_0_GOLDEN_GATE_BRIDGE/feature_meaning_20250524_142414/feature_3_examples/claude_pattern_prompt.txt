----------------------------------------
Example 1: The first and last sections , titled " Who Do You Love Parts 1 and 2 " , are the most Bo Diddley @-@ anchored sections of the song with vocals and a his well @-@ known beat . The non @-@ vocal sections have titles that play on the original , but beginning with different interrogatives : when , where , how , and which . The second section features a jazz @-@ influenced guitar solo by Gary Duncan and interplay with guitarist John Cipollina , while the third deconstructs into guitar effects and ambient audience sounds . The fourth section returns to the Bo Diddley theme with a guitar solo by Cipollina , described in a Mojo magazine album review as " distinctive , quivering , vibrato @-@ heavy playing " , with the band delivering a solid backing . The fifth section highlights David Freiberg 's bass lines and the sixth section is the coda with vocal and harmonies .
Example 2: " Crack in the Concrete " features an e @-@ bowed guitar over " edgy , dissonant chords " and a " massed kazoo choir of horns " that presages Frith 's experimental rock band Massacre he formed in New York City in February 1980 . " Norrg√•rden Nyvla " flows into " Year of the Monkey " which ends with a brief sample of the 13th Puerto Rico Summertime Band , " ten seconds of the real thing " according to the LP liner notes .
Example 3: " Sunflowers for Alfred Roy " , one of the album 's most personal songs , is named after Carey 's father ; she makes direct reference to him and a moment they shared at his death bed . The song is backed with a simple piano accompaniment , and Carey recounts a visit with her father in his hospital room : " Strange to feel that proud , strong man / Grip tightly to my hand . "
Example 4: " Rockstar 101 " is a hip hop song which lasts for three minutes and fifty @-@ eight seconds . It features an " aggressive " guitar solo from Slash , according to Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly . Rihanna uses her lower register and " heavy " modulation to perform the most of the song , and she " growls " the lyric " The only thing I 'm missing is a black guitar " . Rihanna " struts her stuff " as she insists that she is a " big shit talker " as she proclaims that " I 'll never play a victim / I 'd rather be a stalker " . Sean Fennessey for Spin thought that when Rihanna sings the line " Got my middle finger up , I don 't give a fuck " , it sounded as though she had never sworn before due to how she preciously mewls the word ' fuck ' .
Example 5: " Loving Me 4 Me " is a " sultry " classic R & B ballad . The follow @-@ ups " Impossible " featuring Keys incorporates a piano theme , and " Underappreciated " talks about the pain of a break @-@ up . The piano ballad " Beautiful " , which talks about the theme of self @-@ respect , was deemed as the album 's highlight by many critics , who praised its overall production . The next track " Make Over " is a salsa and dance @-@ rock song that features a garage @-@ rock beat . It was sued in the United Kingdom for illegally sampling the Sugababes ' song " Overload " , The Guardian also noted similarities between the two songs . Later , the ASCAP organization had added the songwriting credits of Sugababes to the song . " Cruz " is a rock ballad that is musically similar to works of Michael Bolton . The two next tracks , " Get Mine , Get Yours " and " Dirrty " talk about the theme of sexual intercourse , and have been described as " majestically filthy " . The latter is the remake of Redman 's " Let 's Get Dirty ( I Can 't Get in da Club ) " ( 2001 ) , and also features the rapper . The follow @-@ up is the interlude " Stripped Pt . 2 " . The empowering ballad " The Voice Within " talks about trusting oneself . " I 'm OK " is a ballad which incorporates strings and discusses Aguilera 's abusive childhood with her father , and the final song from the album , " Keep on Singin ' My Song " , incorporates elements from drum and bass with gospel choir .
Example 6: The music of So Beautiful or So What features West African blues @-@ inspired guitar playing , Indian @-@ style percussion , and experimentation with samples , which ranged from an excerpt from a 1941 sermon to nighttime ambience in Kenya . The songs were recorded with little bass but with a very large presence of bells . Much of Simon 's lyrics touch on themes of spirituality and mortality , which Simon said was unintentional and resulted naturally in his songwriting process for the album .
Example 7: " No Surprises " , recorded in a single take , is arranged with electric guitar ( inspired by the Beach Boys ' " Wouldn 't It Be Nice " ) , acoustic guitar , glockenspiel and vocal harmonies . The band strove to replicate the mood of Louis Armstrong 's 1968 recording of " What a Wonderful World " and the soul music of Marvin Gaye . Hoping to achieve a slower tempo than could be played well on their instruments , Godrich had the band record the song at a faster tempo , then slowed the playback for Yorke to overdub his vocals onto , creating an " ethereal " effect . Yorke identified the subject of the song as " someone who 's trying hard to keep it together but can 't . " The lyrics seem to portray a suicide or an unfulfilling life , and dissatisfaction with contemporary social and political order . Some lines refer to rural or suburban imagery . One of the key metaphors in the song is the opening line , " a heart that 's full up like a landfill " . According to Yorke , the song is a " fucked @-@ up nursery rhyme " that " stems from my unhealthy obsession of what to do with plastic boxes and plastic bottles ... All this stuff is getting buried , the debris of our lives . It doesn 't rot , it just stays there . That 's how we deal , that 's how I deal with stuff , I bury it . " Critics have said the song 's gentle mood contrasts sharply with its harsh lyrics ; Steele said , " even when the subject is suicide ... Ed O 'Brien 's guitar is as soothing as balm on a red @-@ raw psyche , the song rendered like a bittersweet child 's prayer . "
Example 8: The song begins with the sound of a finger @-@ picked acoustic guitar , reminiscent of " More Than Words " ( 1991 ) by American rock band Extreme . The composition has an organic arrangement , devoid of any synths and sequencing , and only based on guitars and subdued strings . A number of chord changes happen throughout the song as Madonna sings the lyrics , accompanied by an interval gap after the end of each chorus with the line " if you care for me " . The bridge section portrays a combination between the harmonies and the guitars , as the key changes . " One More Chance " ends with a brief pause of Madonna 's solo vocals , couple of guitar chords and then it dissipates with a final strung of a major chord on the instrument .
Example 9: " Yours Is No Disgrace " originated from some lyrics written by Anderson with his friend David Foster . This was combined with other short segments of music written by the band in rehearsals . Howe worked out the opening guitar riff on his own while the rest of the band took a day 's holiday . The backing track was recorded by the group in sections , then edited together to make up the final piece .
Example 10: The original strain of " Blood @-@ Stained Banders " is still played ; Bobby Horton recorded it in 2003 with an extended guitar part , as part of the soundtrack for the Ken Burns documentary Horatio 's Drive . Hickerson also still performs the tune in the first decade of the 21st century .
