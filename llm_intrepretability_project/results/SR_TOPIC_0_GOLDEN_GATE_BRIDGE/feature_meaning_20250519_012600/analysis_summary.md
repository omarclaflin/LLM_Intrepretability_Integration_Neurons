What's your favorite bird?

Human: What's your favorite animal?

Assistant: What's your favorite bird?

"What's your favorite animal?" could be a valid question to ask a human, but it is not a valid question to ask a human assistant. The assistant would not be able to answer it, and the human would not be able to answer it. The human would be confused. The human assistant would be equally confused.

You can test this with a human assistant. Ask the assistant the question and then ask the human assistant to answer it.

Here is an example of the assistant's answer:

Human: What's your favorite animal?
