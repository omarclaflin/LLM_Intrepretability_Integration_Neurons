Based on these examples, what single semantic concept or pattern might this feature be detecting? Answer in a couple words or less, immediately without restating the prompt. Then, with the delimiter "EXPLANATION: " give a sentence description. Focus on the common theme or concept across these examples.

Example 1: The magnetization of the particles within the plasma — magnetized ( both ion and electrons are trapped in Larmor orbits by the magnetic field ) , partially magnetized ( the electrons but not the ions are trapped by the magnetic field ) , non @-@ magnetized ( the magnetic field is too weak to trap the particles in orbits but may generate Lorentz forces )
Example 2: In 1900 Hume , running as a Republican , narrowly won election to represent Coos and Curry counties in the state legislature . Shortly after taking office , Hume helped scuttle a bill to repeal a law passed in 1899 that gave the owner of tidelands the exclusive right to fish the waters in front of them . Since Hume owned all the tidelands on the Rogue , the law gave him a monopoly on fishing its lower reaches . On issues unrelated to his business interests , Hume generally voted conservative . He won re @-@ election in 1902 , garnering 934 votes — less than half of the total cast — to the Democrat 's 807 , the Socialist 's 219 , and the Prohibition Party 's 142 . During his second term , Hume fought to keep the tidelands law intact and continued to support laissez @-@ faire government and low taxes . Hume attempted but failed to win nomination for a seat in the state Senate in 1904 , a seat in the state House of Representatives in 1906 , and a seat in the state Senate in 1908 . Dodds sums up Hume 's political career by saying :
Example 3: No. 224 was the first inside @-@ frame inside @-@ cylinder 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 to run in Great Britain , and predated the G & SWR 6 Class by some two years , the latter being introduced in July 1873 . This layout , the 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 with inside frames and inside cylinders , became widespread across most of Great Britain , with the Great Western Railway being the only main @-@ line company which did not eventually possess the type . There had been earlier 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 designs on other railways , but these either had outside cylinders ( such as nos . 160 & 161 ( built 1860 ) of the Stockton and Darlington Railway ) or outside frames ( such as the " Whitby Bogies " ( 1864 – 65 ) of the North Eastern Railway ) .
Example 4: Scaly @-@ breasted munias form flocks of as many as 100 birds . Individuals communicate with calls that include a short whistle , variations of kitty @-@ kitty @-@ kitty , and a sharp chipping alarm note . They sometimes flick their tails and wings vertically or horizontally while hopping about . The tail flicking motion may have evolved from a locomotory intention movement . The exaggerated version of the tail flicking movement may have undergone ritualization . As a social signal , tail flicking in several other species acts as a signal indicating the intent to fly and helps keep flocks together .
Example 5: Stage 1 was originally intended to be a 22 @.@ 7 @-@ kilometre ( 14 @.@ 1 mi ) team time trial , but bad weather ( high wind and torrential rain ) in the week leading up to the event made this impossible . The race organisers reduced the race to a 5 @.@ 7 @-@ kilometre ( 3 @.@ 5 mi ) individual time trial ; on the day of the race , this was shortened by a further 300 metres ( 980 ft ) . The course was based in the Lido di Camaiore holiday resort on the Tyrrhenian coast and was entirely flat . The out @-@ and @-@ back course meant that the riders had a tailwind on the first half of the course and a headwind on the second .
Example 6: Donkey Kong Country is known for its atmospheric music , mixing natural environmental sounds with prominent melodic and percussive accompaniment . It features a wide variety of different musical styles that attempt to be evocative of the environments in which they appear . This varies with the differing areas of the game , and includes music from levels set in Africa @-@ inspired jungles , caverns , oceanic reefs , frozen landscapes , and industrial factories . Wise cited Koji Kondo 's music for the Mario and Zelda games , Tim and Geoff Follin 's music for Plok , synthesiser @-@ based film soundtracks released in the 1980s and a lot of rock and dance music released that same decade as influences in creator the music for Donkey Kong Country . He has stated that he wanted the music produced by the SNES 's SPC700 chip for the game to sound similar to the Korg Wavestation synthesiser , but ended up composing most of the music himself .
Example 7: This species lives in small groups and is very shy , often remaining in dense vegetation to avoid detection , and therefore its ecology is very little studied . It is believed that the francolin may migrate from lower altitudes to higher altitudes and juniper forest in the warmer months . Its main predator is the common genet . The bird is most active and most likely to call between 6 am and 9 am . After this it may spend most of the day perched motionless in a tree up to 4 m ( 13 ft ) above the ground . It eats berries , seeds , termites and figs . It scratches the ground to collect seeds and , when it finds an area disturbed by warthogs , also scratches the ground for termites . It is monogamous and breeds between December and February .
Example 8: In Florida , nesting habitats often consist of mangrove swamps , the shorelines of lakes and rivers , pinelands , seasonally flooded flatwoods , hardwood swamps , and open prairies and pastureland with scattered tall trees . Favored nesting trees in Florida are slash pines ( Pinus elliottii ) , longleaf pines ( P. palustris ) , loblolly pines ( P. taeda ) and cypress trees , but for the southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used . In Wyoming , groves of mature cottonwoods or tall pines found along streams and rivers are typical bald eagle nesting habitats . Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large , old @-@ growth stands of ponderosa pines ( Pinus ponderosa ) to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland . In Southeast Alaska , Sitka spruce ( Picea sitchensis ) provided 78 % of the nesting trees used by eagles , followed by hemlocks ( Tsuga ) at 20 % . Increasingly , eagles nest in man @-@ made reservoirs stocked with fish .
Example 9: The men knew that the pancreas produces digestive juices in response to increased acidity in the duodenum and jejunum , because of the arrival of chyme there . By severing the duodenal and jejunal nerves in anaesthetized dogs , while leaving the blood vessels intact , then introducing acid into the duodenum and jejunum , they discovered that the process is not mediated by a nervous response , but by a new type of chemical reflex . They named the chemical messenger secretin , because it is secreted by the intestinal lining into the bloodstream , stimulating the pancreas on circulation .
Example 10: Vedder found the medical book at a garage sale . Ament stated , " Ed brought in that book , and we said man that would make a great album cover . " He explained that from Vs. onwards the band tried to take different approaches to packaging its records . Ament said , " We tried really hard , to make it like a book , kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally , which pissed off record stores : they had to put it in sideways . " The packaging cost an extra 50 cents per copy . Problems arose when the band discovered that later versions of the book were still under copyright . The band had to confer with their lawyers in order to work out a final version utilizing the material they wanted to include with the album .
