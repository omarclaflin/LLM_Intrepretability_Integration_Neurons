 Susan Tedeschi , Derek Trucks , and Dave Brubeck performed the theme song for Not My Life , Bob Dylan 's " Lord Protect My Child " , which was produced by Chris Brubeck . After the initial screenings in early 2011 , the film went through a series of revisions , taking into account information gathered from more than thirty screenings for focus groups . Later that year , the narration was completely rerecorded ; Bilheimer replaced Ashley Judd 's voice with that of Glenn Close , who had previously worked with him on A Closer Walk . The version of the film that was aired by CNN International was shorter than the version shown at the premiere . An even shorter version , only 30 minutes long , was created with school audiences in mind .

 The cost has reduced as wind turbine technology has improved . There are now longer and lighter wind turbine blades , improvements in turbine performance and increased power generation efficiency . Also , wind project capital and maintenance costs have continued to decline . For example , the wind industry in the USA in early 2014 were able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades , capturing the faster winds at higher elevations . This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana , Michigan , and Ohio , the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal . Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt @-@ hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio , saying it is their cheapest option .
