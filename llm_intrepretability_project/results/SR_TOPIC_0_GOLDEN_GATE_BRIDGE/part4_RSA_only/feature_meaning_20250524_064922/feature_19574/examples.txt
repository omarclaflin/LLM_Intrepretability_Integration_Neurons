 Following the extended tour promoting There Is Nothing Left to Lose , which kept the Foo Fighters mostly on the road between 1999 and 2001 , the band started to compose songs for their next album in early 2001 . After demo work in drummer Taylor Hawkins ' home studio in Topanga , the band used the second quarter of 2001 to perform in European festivals . In August , after performing in Chelmsford 's V Festival , Hawkins suffered a heroin overdose that left him in a coma for two days . After taking time off to recover , during which frontman Dave Grohl accepted an offer to play drums for the Queens of the Stone Age on their album Songs for the Deaf , the band got together in October 2001 to continue composition . During November and December , they had been recording at Grohl 's Studio 606 in Alexandria , Virginia , working with both the producer for their previous album , Adam Kasper , and recording engineer Nick Raskulinecz , whom they met after he had engineered " A320 " for Godzilla : The Album . Raskulinecz had just left his job at Sound City Studios , and speculated that Grohl , having found difficulty in ' finding a guy who would commit to sitting in his basement for four months ' , picked him for his energetic and enthusiastic nature .
