The Quarrymen played at parties , school dances , cinemas and amateur skiffle contests before Paul McCartney joined the band in October 1957 . George Harrison joined the band in early 1958 at McCartney 's recommendation , though Lennon initially resisted because he felt Harrison ( still 14 when he was first introduced to Lennon ) to be too young .
