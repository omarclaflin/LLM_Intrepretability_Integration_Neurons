After demo work in drummer Taylor Hawkins ' home studio in Topanga , the band used the second quarter of 2001 to perform in European festivals . In August , after performing in Chelmsford 's V Festival , Hawkins suffered a heroin overdose that left him in a coma for two days . After taking time off to recover , during which frontman Dave Grohl accepted an offer to play drums for the Queens of the Stone Age on their album Songs for the Deaf , the band got together in October 2001 to continue composition . During November and December , they had been recording at Grohl 's Studio 606 in Alexandria , Virginia , working with both the producer for their previous album , Adam Kasper , and recording engineer Nick Raskulinecz , whom they met after he had engineered " A320 " for Godzilla : The Album .
