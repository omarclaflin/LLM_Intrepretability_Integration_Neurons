Another admirer , the writer and actor Mark Gatiss , has said that upon seeing Big Brother he yelled at the television , \" Don 't they know what they 're doing ? [ ... ] It 's The Year of the Sex Olympics ! Nigel Kneale was right ! \" . When The Year of the Sex Olympics was repeated on BBC Four on 22 May 2003 , Paul Hoggart in The Times noted that \" in many respects Kneale was right on the money [ ... ] when you consider that nothing gets contemporary reality show audiences more excited than an emotional train @-@ wreck on live TV \" . \n",
