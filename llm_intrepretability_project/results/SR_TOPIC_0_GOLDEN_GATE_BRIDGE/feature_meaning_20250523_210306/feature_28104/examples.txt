After the initial screenings in early 2011 , the film went through a series of revisions , taking into account information gathered from more than thirty screenings for focus groups . Later that year , the narration was completely rerecorded ; Bilheimer replaced Ashley Judd 's voice with that of Glenn Close , who had previously worked with him on A Closer Walk . The version of the film that was aired by CNN International was shorter than the version shown at the premiere . An even shorter version , only 30 minutes long , was created with school audiences in mind .

Wimmer , Noyce , and producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura went to visit Jolie at her home in France to discuss a possible script and character change . Writer Brian Helgeland helped with the character development and dialogue of the script based on the notes that came out of those discussions with Jolie and to accompany the gender change , the title character 's name was changed to Evelyn Salt .

 Lennon started a skiffle group that was very briefly called the Blackjacks , but changed the name before any public performances . Some accounts credit Lennon with choosing the new name ; other accounts credit his close friend Pete Shotton with suggesting the name . The Quarrymen played at parties , school dances , cinemas and amateur skiffle contests before Paul McCartney joined the band in October 1957 . George Harrison joined the band in early 1958 at McCartney 's recommendation , though Lennon initially resisted because he felt Harrison ( still 14 when he was first introduced to Lennon ) to be too young . Both McCartney and Harrison attended the Liverpool Institute .
