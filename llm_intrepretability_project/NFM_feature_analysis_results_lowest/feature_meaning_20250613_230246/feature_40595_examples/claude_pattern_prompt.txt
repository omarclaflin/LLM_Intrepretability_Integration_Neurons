Example 1: In his book While My Guitar Gently Weeps , Simon Leng describes George Harrison 's musical projects outside the Beatles during 1969 – 70 – such as producing American gospel and soul artists Billy Preston and Doris Troy , and touring with Delaney & Bonnie and Friends – as the completion of " a musical @-@ philosophical circle " , which resulted in his post @-@ Beatles solo album All Things Must Pass ( 1970 ) . Among the songs on that triple album , " My Sweet Lord " and " Awaiting on You All " each reflect Harrison 's immersion in Krishna Consciousness , via his association with the UK branch of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness ( ISKCON ) , known as the Radha Krishna Temple . An ISKCON devotee since 1970 , author Joshua Greene writes of All Things Must Pass providing an " intimately detailed account of a spiritual journey " , which had begun with Harrison 's embracing of Hinduism while in India in September – October 1966 .
Example 2: They are jailed by a befuddled town policeman , Constable Slocum ( Walter Catlett ) , for breaking into the house of Dr. Fritz Lehman ( Fritz Feld ) ( where they had cornered the circus leopard ) . When Slocum does not believe their story , Susan tells him they are members of the " Leopard Gang " ; she calls herself " Swingin ' Door Susie " , and David " Jerry the Nipper " . David fails to convince the constable that Susan makes things up " from motion pictures she 's seen " . Eventually , Alexander Peabody ( George Irving ) shows up to verify everyone 's identity . Susan ( who has sneaked out a window ) unwittingly drags the irritated circus leopard into the jail ; David saves her , using a chair to shoo the big cat into a cell .
Example 3: Rating Charmbracelet two out of five stars , Barry Walters from Rolling Stone wrote that none of the songs were bold , that the lack of hooks made the album weak , and said , " Carey needs bold songs that help her use the power and range for which she is famous . Charmbracelet is like a stream of watercolors that bleed into a puddle of brown . " Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine complimented Carey 's mixture of pop and hip @-@ hop melodies , and wrote , " Though there 's nothing as immediate as ' Fantasy ' or ' My All ' here , Charmbracelet is significantly less contrived than 1999 's Rainbow and almost as creatively liberating as Butterfly . British columnist Angus Batey , writing for Yahoo ! Music UK called the songs on Charmbracelet forgettable , and wrote , " She used to take risks , but ' Charmbracelet ' is conservative , unadventurous and uninspiring ; and , while it 's understandable that simply to make another record marks a triumph of sorts , it 's impossible to admire Mariah to the degree that her talent ought to merit . " John Mulvey from NME criticized its content , writing , " Nominally , ' Charmbracelet ' is R & B , much like Tony Blair is nominally a socialist ... Tragedies , all told , have been worse "
Example 4: Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team , which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways . A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates ' turns batting , such as on a hit or by other means . The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs . One turn batting for both teams , beginning with the visiting team , constitutes an inning . A game is composed of nine innings , and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins . Baseball has no game clock , although almost all games end in the ninth inning .
Example 5: Greg LeMond was born in Lakewood , California , and raised in Washoe Valley which is ranch country on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range , two miles north of Carson City and 18 miles south of Reno . His parents are Bob LeMond and Bertha ( d . 2006 ) , and he has two sisters , Kathy and Karen . He attended Earl Wooster High School in Reno , NV . Greg frequently rode his bike to high school , sometimes cutting class to get home early . He would then ride a loop west over Mt . Rose , south along Lake Tahoe , then east on Hwy 28 to Carson City . Then Greg would follow Carson Street over the hill to Washoe Valley and his home .
Example 6: Tomáš Berdych and Federer have played each other 22 times with Federer leading 16 – 6 . Federer leads 9 – 5 on hard courts , 2 – 1 on grass courts , 4 – 0 on clay courts , and 1 – 0 on carpet . Berdych won their first professional match , notably upsetting then world No. 1 Federer at the 2004 Summer Olympics . Federer then went on to win their next eight meetings , before Berdych ended the losing streak in 2010 . Between 2010 and 2013 , Berdych won 5 of 8 meetings . Federer then switched to a larger racquet in 2014 to prevent being overpowered by players like Berdych and leads 5 – 0 since . They have met seven times in Grand Slam tournaments , with Federer leading 5 – 2 , and Berdych is one of five players , along with Arnaud Clément , Álex Corretja , David Nalbandian , and Jo @-@ Wilfried Tsonga , to defeat Federer multiple times in majors before the semifinal stage . Their most notable Grand Slam matches took place in the 2009 Australian Open , when Federer prevailed in five sets after dropping the first two sets , the 2010 Wimbledon Championships , the 2012 US Open , both of which Berdych won in four sets. and the 2016 Australian Open , which Federer won in straight sets .

Example 8: The album 's sound also incorporates diverse musical elements from various genres such as funk , soul , rock , dubstep , and electro music . Houston Press writer Shea Serrano describes the album as a " new take on the traditional Southern rap sound . It 's slow and fast , wonky and flimsy , lyrical and hook @-@ driven " . Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media perceives " 1980s synth @-@ funk " as its predominant musical element , but also finds each track musically varied , stating " New melodic elements flit in and out of tracks just as you start to notice them , and there 's a lot going on at any given moment " . Big Boi has called the music " basically what you been getting from Outkast . Raw lyricism and the funkiest grooves you can lay your ears on . "
Example 9: None of the quintet attacked each other , and they remained as one into the final 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) of the stage . Kišerlovski played his hand first , launching an attack with 3 @.@ 5 km ( 2 @.@ 2 mi ) remaining , but Péraud closed down the move almost immediately ; a secondary move took Martínez and Gautier out of the equation for the stage victory . Péraud accelerated again and Millar latched onto his wheel with Kišerlovski unable to follow the pair . Millar took the front inside the final 1 km ( 0 @.@ 6 mi ) , but Péraud remained on his wheel until just before 200 m ( 660 ft ) to go ; he launched his attack , but Millar beat him to the line for his fourth individual stage victory at the Tour – his first since 2003 – and the fourth different British rider to take a stage win at the 2012 Tour . The peloton was led across the line almost eight minutes down by the top two in the points classification , Orica – GreenEDGE 's Matthew Goss and Liquigas – Cannondale 's Peter Sagan . Sagan protested the sprint finish of Goss , feeling that he had impeded him in the closing metres . Race officials agreed with Sagan and demoted Goss to seventh – helped in part by a one @-@ second time gap between them and the rest of the field – and penalised him 30 points in the classification , and 30 seconds overall .
Example 10: A geneticist whose work helped Killian to create Extremis . Hall said Hansen would be a " strong female character , " and described her decision to take the role , saying , " I decided to do Iron Man 3 because I 've never done the ' hurry up and wait ' movie before . Even the studio movies I 've done have been small studio movies , or indie films that we made on a wing and a prayer . I love those , but Iron Man is refreshing in a way because it 's something out of my realm of experiences . "
