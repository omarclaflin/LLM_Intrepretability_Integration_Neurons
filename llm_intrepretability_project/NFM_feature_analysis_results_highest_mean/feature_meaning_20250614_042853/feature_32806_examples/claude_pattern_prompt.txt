Example 1: Meyerbeer 's relationship with Heine displays the awkwardness and prickliness of the social personae of both parties . Meyerbeer , apart from any of his personal feelings , needed Heine onside as an influential personality and writer on music . He genuinely admired Heine 's verse , and made a number of settings from it . Heine , living in Paris from 1830 , always equivocal about his loyalties between Judaism and Christianity , and always short of money , asked Meyerbeer to intervene with Heine 's own family for financial support and frequently took loans and money from Meyerbeer himself . He was not above threatening Meyerbeer with blackmail by writing satirical pieces about him ( and indeed Meyerbeer paid Heine 's widow to suppress such writings ) . And yet , at Heine 's death in 1856 , Meyerbeer wrote in his diary ' Peace be to his ashes . I forgive him from my heart for his ingratitude and many wickednesses against me.'
Example 2: During his assignment in Paris , Abu Nuwar met King Talal 's son and successor , Crown Prince Hussein , who frequently visited the city during weekend breaks from his training at the Sandhurst Military Academy . Abu Nuwar was keen to gain Hussein 's favor and disseminate to him Arab nationalist ideas calling for an end to British influence in the Jordanian military . Hussein was enthused by Abu Nuwar , and after his enthronement in May 1953 , Hussein attempted to have Abu Nuwar return to Jordan despite Glubb 's reservations . In August , Hussein visited London where he invited Abu Nuwar and other like @-@ minded officers , including Free Officer Shahir Abu Shahut , to meet with him . There , Abu Shahut informed Abu Nuwar of the Free Officers ' plans to " Arabize " the Arab Legion , i.e. remove the force 's British leadership , including Glubb . Afterward , Abu Nuwar informed Hussein at a party celebrating his enthronement that he was a leading member of the Free Officers ( though he was not ) and communicated the group 's desire to assert Arab command over the Arab Legion , an aim to which Hussein was receptive . Hussein was impressed by Abu Nuwar who vocally condemned the British presence in Jordan during the party , which earned Abu Nuwar cheers by Jordanian officers .
Example 3: In " Band of Brothers " ( 1993 ) , Tessa is chosen as the curator of a traveling exhibition entitled " An historical retrospective on sculpture and form " , which is based in Paris , France . Meanwhile , Immortal Grayson ( James Horan ) is seeking Victor Paulus , a protegee of MacLeod 's friend Darius ( Werner Stocker ) . Tessa decides to leave to Paris before MacLeod fights Grayson and her parting words are : " Remember . Paris is our city . I 'll be waiting for you " . After MacLeod beheads Grayson , he , Tessa and Richie , live in a barge on the Seine near Notre Dame de Paris .
Example 4: Meanwhile , in Paris Meyerbeer began to seek new libretti , initially considering Le prophète of Scribe , Le cinq mars by Henri Saint @-@ Georges and eventually settling on Scribe 's Vasco da Gama ( later to become L 'Africaine ) , which he contracted to complete by 1840 . However , Meyerbeer had envisaged that the main role in L 'Africaine would be written for Falcon ; after the catastrophic failure of her voice in 1837 , he turned instead to Le prophète .
Example 5: At the same time as his successes in Paris , Meyerbeer , as a Prussian Court Kapellmeister ( Director of Music ) from 1832 , and from 1843 as Prussian General Music Director , was also influential in opera in Berlin and throughout Germany . He was an early supporter of Richard Wagner , enabling the first production of the latter 's opera , Rienzi . He was commissioned to write the patriotic opera Ein Feldlager in Schlesien to celebrate the reopening of the Berlin Royal Opera House in 1844 and wrote music for certain Prussian state occasions .
Example 6: In Paris Meyerbeer had been asked by Louis Véron , the director of the Opéra , for a new work . At first he attempted to persuade Véron to accept the opéra @-@ comique Le portefaix to a libretto by Scribe , which he had been contracted to compose in early 1831 ; but Véron insisted on a full five @-@ act piece . Together with Scribe , Meyerbeer reviewed many subjects before deciding , in 1832 , on Les Huguenots . The contract which Meyerbeer signed with Véron contained a penalty clause if the work was not delivered by the end of 1833 . When the time came and the opera was not ready , Véron claimed his 30 @,@ 000 francs under this clause ; Meyerbeer was perhaps unique amongst composers in being able to pay this . In fact Véron refunded the money under a further agreement , when the opera was delivered in late 1834 ; but Veron himself was replaced as director of the Opera by Henri Duponchel before Les Huguenots was premiered on 29 February 1836 . It was an immediate and immense success , its splendid staging and effects exceeding even those of Fromental Halévy 's La Juive , which had premiered the previous year . Berlioz called the score " a musical encyclopaedia " , and the singing , especially of Nourrit and Falcon , was universally praised . Les Huguenots was the first opera to be performed at the Opéra more than 1 @,@ 000 times ( the 1,000th performance being on 16 May 1906 ) and continued to be produced up to 1936 , more than a century after its premiere . Its many performances in all other of the world 's major opera houses give it a claim to being the most successful opera of the 19th century .
Example 7: Robert was born in England , probably in about 1100 . Nothing else is known of his background . He owed his name to the place where he taught , Melun in France . Robert studied under Peter Abelard and Hugh of St. Victor at the University of Paris , where in 1137 he succeeded Abelard as a teacher in the school on Mont Ste @-@ Geneviève . John of Salisbury and William of Tyre were among his pupils in Paris . King Henry II of England 's cousin , Roger of Worcester , later the Bishop of Worcester , was another of Robert 's students . He probably also taught Thomas Becket , later Archbishop of Canterbury , although this is not certain .
Example 8: Letellier describes Meyerbeer 's mature life as ' a tale of two cities ... His artistic triumph and legendary status were achieved in Paris ... but he never abandoned Prussia , especially his home city of Berlin ' . His wife Minna was based in Berlin ( she did not enjoy Paris ) as was his beloved mother ; and he had a series of Royal duties from the Prussian court , stemming from his appointment as Court Kapellmeister in 1832 . For these reasons his life from 1830 onwards is characterised by travel between these two centres .
Example 9: With the continuing delays in the production of Le prophète and L 'Africaine , Meyerbeer was now becoming subject to increasing sniping in Paris . In 1846 Meyerbeer began work on a new project with Scribe and Saint @-@ Georges , Noëma , but in the following year Pillet was sacked from the opera and the direction was resumed by Duponchel . As a consequence , Meyerbeer was at last able to stage Le prophète with a cast to his liking , ( including Viardot as Fidès ) , and it premiered on 16 April 1849 . Again Meyerbeer 's new opera was an outstanding success – despite the unusual feature of the lead female role being the hero 's mother , rather than his lover . Amongst those at the 47th performance in February 1850 was Richard Wagner , now an impoverished political exile ; the success of a work so fundamentally against his own operatic principles was one of the spurs to his spiteful anti @-@ Jewish denunciation of Meyerbeer and Mendelssohn , ' Das Judenthum in der Musik ' ( 1850 ) .
Example 10: Robert of Melun ( c . 1100 – 27 February 1167 ) was an English scholastic Christian theologian who taught in France , and later became Bishop of Hereford in England . He studied under Peter Abelard in Paris before teaching there and at Melun , which gave him his surname . His students included John of Salisbury , Roger of Worcester , William of Tyre , and possibly Thomas Becket . Robert was involved in the Council of Reims in 1148 , which condemned the teachings of Gilbert de la Porrée . Three of his theological works survive , and show him to have been strictly orthodox .
