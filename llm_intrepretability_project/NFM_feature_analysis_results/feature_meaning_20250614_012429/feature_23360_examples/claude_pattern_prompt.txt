Example 1: Shankar saw about half the film in a roughly edited version before composing the background score , but he was already familiar with the story . According to Robinson , when Ray met Shankar the latter hummed a tune that was folk @-@ based but had " a certain sophistication " . This tune , usually played on a bamboo flute , became the main theme for the film . The majority of the score was composed within the duration of a single night , in a session that lasted for about eleven hours . Shankar also composed two solo sitar pieces — one based on the raga Desh ( traditionally associated with rain ) , and one sombre piece based on the raga Todi . He created a piece based on the raga Patdeep , played on the tar shehnai , to accompany the scene in which Harihar learns of Durga 's death . The film 's cinematographer , Subrata Mitra , performed on the sitar for parts of the soundtrack .
Example 2: The Bengali word path literally means path , and pather means " of the path " . The word panchali refers to a type of narrative folk song that used to be performed in Bengal and was the forerunner of another type of folk performance , the jatra . English translations of the Bengali title include Song of the Little Road , The Lament of the Path , Song of the Road , and Song of the Open Road .
Example 3: For the techniques used to craft the overall sound of the album , August Brown of the Los Angeles Times described the band foregoing the use of full chords and verse @-@ chorus @-@ verse structures in favor of " distant guitar effects , crunchy bass grooves and smatterings of percussion . " Regarding the songs from the album , Maust said that lead singer Nathan Willett 's lyrics were a mixture of folk tales and topical stories , stating that " a lot of people say the last record was more about yesteryear . This [ new record ] has some of that , but it 's much more today . The characters are people from today . " The thirteen tracks off the album deal with a variety of philosophies and politics that range from contemplating suicide , crisis of faith , alienation , anonymity , public security and job satisfaction .
Example 4: Between late 1964 and the middle of 1966 , Dylan created a body of work that remains unique . Drawing on folk , blues , country , R & B , rock 'n'roll , gospel , British beat , symbolist , modernist and Beat poetry , surrealism and Dada , advertising jargon and social commentary , Fellini and Mad magazine , he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision . The beauty of these albums retains the power to shock and console . "
Example 5: Initially modeling his writing style on the songs of Woody Guthrie , the blues of Robert Johnson , and what he termed the " architectural forms " of Hank Williams songs , Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s , infusing it " with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry " . Paul Simon suggested that Dylan 's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre : " [ Dylan 's ] early songs were very rich ... with strong melodies . ' Blowin ' in the Wind ' has a really strong melody . He so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated it for a while . He defined the genre for a while . "
Example 6: If Dylan 's work in the 1960s was seen as bringing intellectual ambition to popular music , critics in the 21st century described him as a figure who had greatly expanded the folk culture from which he initially emerged . Following the release of Todd Haynes ' Dylan biopic I 'm Not There , J. Hoberman wrote in his 2007 Village Voice review :
Example 7: As the elder sibling , Durga cares for Apu with motherly affection , but spares no opportunity to tease him . Together , they share the simple joys of life : sitting quietly under a tree , viewing pictures in a travelling vendor 's bioscope , running after the candy man who passes through the village , and watching a jatra ( folk theatre ) performed by a troupe of actors . Every evening they are delighted by the sound of a distant train 's whistle . One day , they run away from home to catch a glimpse of the train , only to discover Indir lying dead on their return .
Example 8: Christina Milian is the self @-@ titled debut studio album by American singer Christina Milian released by Def Soul on October 9 , 2001 . Its release was postponed because of the September 11 attacks , which occurred just two weeks before its release date . Her label opted to release it later that year in Europe , but due to changing music trends , Milian decided not to release the album domestically .
Example 9: Elvis might never have been born , but someone else would surely have brought the world rock ' n ' roll . No such logic accounts for Bob Dylan . No iron law of history demanded that a would @-@ be Elvis from Hibbing , Minnesota , would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world 's first and greatest rock ' n ' roll beatnik bard and then — having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning — vanish into a folk tradition of his own making .
Example 10: Iron Man 3 was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in digital download form on September 3 , 2013 . This was followed by the film 's release on Blu @-@ ray disc , 3D Blu @-@ ray , DVD , digital copy , and on demand on September 24 , 2013 . The home video release includes a Marvel One @-@ Shot short film titled Agent Carter starring Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter from Captain America : The First Avenger . It debuted atop the DVD and Blu @-@ ray charts in the United States , and second in the rental charts behind World War Z. As of January 31 , 2014 , Iron Man 3 is the eighth best @-@ selling DVD of 2013 , earning more than $ 79 million in sales in the U.S.
