 Shankar saw about half the film in a roughly edited version before composing the background score , but he was already familiar with the story . According to Robinson , when Ray met Shankar the latter hummed a tune that was folk @-@ based but had " a certain sophistication " . This tune , usually played on a bamboo flute , became the main theme for the film . The majority of the score was composed within the duration of a single night , in a session that lasted for about eleven hours . Shankar also composed two solo sitar pieces — one based on the raga Desh ( traditionally associated with rain ) , and one sombre piece based on the raga Todi . He created a piece based on the raga Patdeep , played on the tar shehnai , to accompany the scene in which Harihar learns of Durga 's death . The film 's cinematographer , Subrata Mitra , performed on the sitar for parts of the soundtrack .

 Initially modeling his writing style on the songs of Woody Guthrie , the blues of Robert Johnson , and what he termed the " architectural forms " of Hank Williams songs , Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s , infusing it " with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry " . Paul Simon suggested that Dylan 's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre : " [ Dylan 's ] early songs were very rich ... with strong melodies . ' Blowin ' in the Wind ' has a really strong melody . He so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated it for a while . He defined the genre for a while . "
