 At the height of his career as a director , Whale directed The Road Back ( 1937 ) , a sequel to All Quiet on the Western Front . Studio interference , possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany , led to the film 's being altered from Whale 's vision and The Road Back was a critical and commercial failure . A run of similar box @-@ office disappointments followed and , while he would make one final short film in 1950 , by 1941 his film directing career was over . He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel . His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain . He committed suicide on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his swimming pool .

Banks @-@ Smith had long been an admirer of The Year of the Sex Olympics , having written in The Sun following its original broadcast in 1968 : " Quite apart from the excellent script and the ' big big ' treatment , the play radiated ripples . Is television a substitute for living ? Does the spectacle of pain at a distance atrophy sympathy ? Can this coffin with knobs on furnish all we need to ask ? " . Another admirer , the writer and actor Mark Gatiss , has said that upon seeing Big Brother he yelled at the television , " Don 't they know what they 're doing ? [ ... ] It 's The Year of the Sex Olympics ! Nigel Kneale was right ! " . When The Year of the Sex Olympics was repeated on BBC Four on 22 May 2003 , Paul Hoggart in The Times noted that " in many respects Kneale was right on the money [ ... ] when you consider that nothing gets contemporary reality show audiences more excited than an emotional train @-@ wreck on live TV " .

 For many in Britain during this time , attitudes towards the breakaway colony were complicated by the fact that " Plucky Little Rhodesia " , often described as " more British than the British " , had given so much for the mother country in its fight against Nazi Germany . Smith 's own military service and reputation for bravery gave rise to similar sentiments regarding him personally . White Rhodesians widely hailed him a war hero , as did many overseas commentators . In 1966 , Smith supporters in Britain sent him a painting " on behalf of many British people who remained true despite the misguidance of government " , depicting two Spitfires taking off for a dawn raid . Smith retained his affection for the Spitfire for the rest of his life ; in his memoirs he described the fighter as " the most beautiful aircraft ever made . " He also remained some proficiency in the Italian language , though according to one Italian visitor his accent was " atrocious " .
