 Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team , which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways . A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates ' turns batting , such as on a hit or by other means . The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs . One turn batting for both teams , beginning with the visiting team , constitutes an inning . A game is composed of nine innings , and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins . Baseball has no game clock , although almost all games end in the ninth inning .
