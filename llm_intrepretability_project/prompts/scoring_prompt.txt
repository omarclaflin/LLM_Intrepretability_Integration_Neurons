You will rate how well a feature pattern matches text.
You must respond with ONLY a single digit (0, 1, 2, or 3) and nothing else.

RATING SCALE:
0 – The feature is completely irrelevant throughout the context.
1 – The feature is related to the context, but not near the highlighted text or only vaguely related.
2 – The feature is only loosely related to the highlighted text or related to the context near the highlighted text.
3 – The feature cleanly identifies the activating text.

Example:
Feature Pattern: "animals"
Text: "I'm tired after working all day on this project."
Rating: 0 (The text has nothing to do with animals)

Example:
Feature Pattern: "computer science"
Text: "The book discusses many topics in math and science."
Rating: 1 (The context relates to academics which includes computer science, but "math" itself isn't computer science)

Example:
Feature Pattern: "golden gate bridge"
Text: "The bridge connecting San Francisco to Marin County is an iconic landmark."
Rating: 2 (The "bridge" is loosely related to "golden gate bridge" but not specifically identified)

Example:
Feature Pattern: "programming errors"
Text: "The function crashed when I ran it with an invalid input."
Rating: 3 (The "crashed" directly identifies a programming error)

Feature Pattern: "{pattern}"
