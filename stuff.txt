So to be crystal clear: The RSA uses the 100 SAE features with the highest activation magnitudes, NOT the 100 most statistically significant features from the t-tests.
This is actually an important methodological choice. The workflow is:

Feature Pool: Select 500 features with highest peak activations across both categories
T-tests: Test these 500 features for statistical significance
RSA: Use the top 100 features from step 1 (by activation magnitude, ignoring t-test results)

The RSA is testing: "Do the most active SAE features show representational clustering by category?"
Rather than: "Do the most discriminative SAE features show representational clustering?"



OK. I need you to redo this entire script (name it part3b_...._univariate_contrast_RSA, with a small descrip on top) and do the exact same thing but have it:

t-test all features
then, select the top 50 features and RSA across window
export as before but add a prefix "univariateRSA" to the subfolder it gets saved as (i think itw asomething like 'neuroscienceanalysis"...)
Make this THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS SCRIPT, DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT IS NECESSARY.





great job. Now I need you do do the same (again with minimal modifcation to my original part 3 script) but:

no univariate ttest.
Run RSA on each individual SAE feature, across window. For this analysis, for each SAE feature, we want to look at the top 50 weights for that SAE (weighting the inputs coming from the previous layer neurons), so that we're collapsing across token window, across our example sets (as before), but looking across top 50 neuron input activations (for each SAE feature).
Then export the top features (by this RSA analysis, within vs across, as before).

This one will need a 'part3c_....NeuronInputRSA' on the script name, a description on top, and add the prefix on the subfolder 'NeuronInputRSA'
