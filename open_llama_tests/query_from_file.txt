You must respond with ONLY a single digit (0, 1, 2, or 3) and nothing else.

RATING SCALE:
0 – The feature is completely irrelevant throughout the context.
1 – The feature is related to the context, but not near the highlighted text or only vaguely related.
2 – The feature is only loosely related to the highlighted text or related to the context near the highlighted text.
3 – The feature cleanly identifies the activating text.

Feature Pattern: "dates and date ranges"
