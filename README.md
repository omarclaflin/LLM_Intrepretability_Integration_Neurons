# LLM Feature Integration Analysis

This project investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) encode feature integration in addition to feature identity. The research is inspired by the question: "Do LLMs encode feature integration, in addition to feature identity?" as discussed in [Information Space Contains Computations, Not Just Features](https://omarclaflin.com/2025/06/14/information-space-contains-computations-not-just-features/).

## Project Overview

This project analyzes how LLMs process and integrate features through several key components:

1. **Feature Analysis**
   - Extracts and analyzes features from LLM activations using Sparse Autoencoders (SAE)
   - Identifies feature patterns and their activation statistics
   - Examines feature specificity and interactions between features

2. **Feature Integration Studies**
   - Analyzes how features combine and interact in the model
   - Studies both linear and non-linear feature interactions
   - Investigates feature co-activation patterns

3. **Intervention Analysis**
   - Performs feature clamping experiments to understand feature roles
   - Conducts category classification experiments
   - Analyzes feature importance in different contexts

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals several important aspects of feature processing in LLMs:

1. **Feature Identity**
   - Individual features show specific activation patterns
   - Features can be mapped to distinct semantic concepts
   - Feature activation statistics show varying degrees of specificity

2. **Feature Integration**
   - Features demonstrate both linear and non-linear interactions
   - Co-activation patterns reveal feature relationships
   - Feature importance varies across different contexts

3. **Computational Properties**
   - Features encode not just static properties but also computational relationships
   - Feature interactions show evidence of compositional processing
   - The model demonstrates both local and distributed feature representations

## Analysis Methods

The project employs several sophisticated analysis techniques:

1. **Feature Extraction**
   - Uses Sparse Autoencoders to identify meaningful features
   - Analyzes feature activation patterns across different contexts
   - Computes feature statistics and importance metrics

2. **Visualization**
   - Creates token-level activation visualizations
   - Generates feature interaction plots
   - Produces comprehensive analysis summaries

3. **Intervention Studies**
   - Performs controlled feature clamping experiments
   - Conducts category classification tests
   - Analyzes feature behavior under different conditions

## Results

The analysis provides insights into how LLMs process and integrate features:

1. **Feature Patterns**
   - Features show consistent activation patterns across similar contexts
   - Feature importance varies based on task and context
   - Features demonstrate both specialized and general-purpose roles

2. **Integration Mechanisms**
   - Features combine through both linear and non-linear mechanisms
   - Integration patterns show evidence of hierarchical processing
   - Feature interactions reveal computational properties

3. **Computational Properties**
   - Features encode not just static properties but dynamic relationships
   - Integration patterns suggest compositional processing
   - The model demonstrates sophisticated feature combination mechanisms

This project contributes to our understanding of how LLMs process and integrate features, revealing both the presence of feature identity and the mechanisms of feature integration in these models.
