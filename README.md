# LLM Feature Integration Analysis

This project investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) encode feature integration in addition to feature identity. The research is inspired by the question: "Do LLMs encode feature integration, in addition to feature identity?" as discussed in [Information Space Contains Computations, Not Just Features](https://omarclaflin.com/2025/06/14/information-space-contains-computations-not-just-features/).

## Project Overview

The residual error from SAE reconstruction was mapped with another SAE (no contribution) vs a non-linear method (NFM), and showed that the residual reconstruction space contains significant (+3-12% relative reconstruction improvement) non-linear mapping, that, importantly contributes to the accuracy of the neuron network activations.

## Results

Summary: Basically, an NFM contribute 3-12% relative loss reduction on a SAE reconstruction, in accordance with my hypothesis that features may have meaningful non-linear interactions in neuron activation space. 
I might add later to this section later, listed here for now: (https://omarclaflin.com/2025/06/14/information-space-contains-computations-not-just-features/)

## Relevance/Related Phenomena:

Some prior observations that may be explained by 'feature integration'/'feature interactions':

- Some insight on 'interference' and 'noise'

- Why polysemantic neurons are so robust (they're doing integration, not just storage)

- Why SAEs miss some variance (they ignore integration)

- Possibly why some less intrepretable features (e.g. perhaps High Frequency Latents contain a large set of non-linearly integrated subfeatures?)

- A more intrepretable space for the observed polysemantic neurons

- One potential source for the 'dark matter' of computation

- Insights/approaches into nuanced feature interactions: feature interactions related to safety, bias, alignment, etc

- Potentially how 'binding' works in neuroscience/artifical neuroscience?
