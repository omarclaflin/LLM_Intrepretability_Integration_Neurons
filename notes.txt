--cahnge 'positive' 'negative' to state1 state2 (claudia being biased & politically incorrect)
--run feature finding script once we
   -- get a prompt file

--Do we bother with 'SAE single feature exploartion'
	--feature exploration of SAE requires huge pool of inputs
	--top inputs that activate it
	--claude to summarize them by similarity
	--confirmation analysis/manipulation
--> we're focusing on 1.) targetted concepts and 2.) 'information integration'

	--> FOR 1, we SHOULD:
		-classifier on layer weights for those prompts
		-vs RSA
		-ALSO look at SAE (and discuss the advantage of this 'dimensional reduction' technique (explosion/separation) it it works)
			-> confirm with feature look
			-> confirm with manipulation analysis
	--> FOR 2
		->above but just two concepts (states) combined
		->repeated but for interacting concepts
		->distinguish 'sets of feature-relevant neurons' which can overlap, or co-exist, from 'feature-integrating neurons'

			--> need to confirm with casual manipulation
				(e.g. jamming integration neuron one way or the other, with related prompts)


Key Differences:
-They looked at features that were absent or present (e.g. 'Golden Gate Bridge' vs no mention of it). I'm looking at categories with different states (e.g. Light vs Heavy, (weight)).

-They were exploratory (e.g. individual SAE features drove analysis), and I'm targetted (e.g. combination of layer neurons, or SAE features, that describe our targetted concept).


Impact: Quantify 'interaction' of features, based on 'neural code' changes. Safety: To what degree does gender and profession, intergrate (when producing a response)?




Top K layer neurons --> 'focused ROI analysis'
Or just combining Feature 1+Feature 2 --> combined map (but all neurons)
	-> check this with (F1) + (F2) vs (F1 + F2) prompts

Top L SAE features
Top L SAE features AND Top K layer neurons
